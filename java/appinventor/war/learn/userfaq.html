       <h2>
        Why App Inventor?
       </h2>
       <p>
        We're seeing a fundamental shift in the way people are using their mobile devices.
                Smartphones, including Android devices and the iPhone, provide users with a
                fully-featured Internet in their pocket. As people become more comfortable
                accessing the mobile web, we want to enable them to create mobile services and
                applications that allow them to engage the mobile space as developers regardless of
                their computer programming knowledge. App Inventor for Android is an experimental
                program that allows us to do just that. For educators, App Inventor has become a
                powerful tool for exposing students to the world of computer programming and
                helping them become creators of technology rather than just consumers of it.

        Can I use App Inventor without a phone?
       </h2>
       <p>
        Yes. App Inventor includes an emulator for the phone. The emulator can’t do
                everything the phone can. For example, you can’t shake it but you can create apps
                and try them out. Once you've

       <p>
        App Inventor users need to have a Google Account. The login authentication and
                storage for App Inventor projects is linked to your Google Account.

        Can I develop in App Inventor and export the source code to Eclipse or some other
                IDE to work on it further?

       <p>
        No, App Inventor does not generate Java source code.

       <h2>
        Can I share project code with other App Inventor users?
       </h2>
       <p>
        Yes. To share a project, go to the My Projects page, select a project, then choose
        <span class="ButtonText">
         More Actions
        </span>
        |
        <span class="ButtonText">
         Download
                Source
        </span>
        . This will create a zip file that you can share with others. To
                upload a project, go to My Projects, choose
        <span class="ButtonText">

        <b>
         Note:
        </b>
        The source code (.zip)
                files are not executable Android programs -- those are .apk files. The source code
                is also not Java SDK code -- it can only be loaded into App Inventor.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Can I share my apps with other Android users?
       </h2>
       <p>
        Yes. To share an app, you first need to obtain an Android Package (.apk) file,
                which you can do by going to the My Projects page, clicking on the name of the app
                you want to share (which will take you to the Design page), and selecting
        <span class="ButtonText">
         Package for Phone

        |
        <span class="ButtonText">
         Download to this Computer
        </span>
        . You can then email the app to your
                friends, who can install it by opening the email from their phone, or you can
                upload it to a website that both you and your friend can access. Note that they
                will need to

       <h2>
        Can I build multi-screen apps with App Inventor?
       </h2>
       <p>
        Currently, you can't create multi-screen apps with App Inventor. If the layouts of
                the screens you want are the same, you can do things like switch the text and
                images of components to make it look like a new screen has appeared. Ellen Spertus
                points out that, "you can currently sort of do this through a hack: having
        <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/millscs80/android-faq#TOC-Can-one-app-have-multiple-screens-">
         one app launch another app"
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <h2>
        Is App Inventor only a toy language? Can I build sophisticated apps with it?
       </h2>
       <p>
        Though App Inventor has limitations, it can be used to build complex apps. The
                language provides programming constructs like foreach, while, and if-else, in
                visual (block) form. High-level components and operations (blocks) for some of the
                Android functionality exists, though not all of it. There are mechanisms for
                communicating with web services and databases. A component development kit is being
                considered. This will allow programmers to build App Inventor components with Java
                and expand the functionality of App Inventor.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Can I connect to web services from an app written in App Inventor?
       </h2>
       <p>
        You can connect App Inventor apps to the web using the TinyWebDB component. The
                TinyWebDB component can communicate with any service that conforms to a particular
                protocol. During our pilot, Dave Wolber from the University of San Francisco wrote
                some Android apps that talk to Amazon, San Francisco's NextMuni API for getting
                transit information, and Yahoo finance. Here are some links to help:

        Is it possible to bring in multiple authors on a single project?
       </h2>
       <p>
        No. As of now, the only way to work together is to share source code, as described
