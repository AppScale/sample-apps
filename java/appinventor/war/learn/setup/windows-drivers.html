        The AppInventor Setup software includes the
        <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/win-usb.html">
         Google USB driver
        </a>
        , which
                handles the following devices:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         T-Mobile G1* / ADP1
        </li>
        <li>
         T-Mobile myTouch 3G* / Google Ion / ADP2
        </li>
        <li>
         Verizon Droid (not Droid X)
        </li>
        <li>
         Nexus One
         <br />
        </li>
        <li>
         Nexus S
         <br />
        </li>
       </ul>
       If your phone is on of these, then the driver should have been installed along
              with the AppInventor Setup software. All other devices will require you to obtain and
              install a USB driver from the device manufacturer. In either case it's a good idea to
              check the driver installation, as described below, before proceeding.
       <p>
        You can find links to drivers for many Android devices at

        </a>
        .
                If your device is not listed, we recommend you search the manufacturer's website
                for information on how to install drivers for your particular phone and/or review
                these resources:

         In following the manufacturer instructions, note that you do not need to install
                  the complete Android SDK, just the drivers for your device. The other parts of
                  the SDK were installed when you installed the App Inventor Setup software.

         Checking and installing the drivers requires facility with using the Windows
                  command line and the Windows device manager. If you are not experienced using
                  Windows in this way, you may want to get help with this. You can also ask for
                  advice in the

       <h2>
        Checking the driver installation:
       </h2>
       <p>
        It's been our experience that the Windows drivers do not always correctly install
                automatically. Here's how to check the driver:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Open a Command Prompt window and navigate to the directory where the software
                was installed. For example, if you installed the Setup software as an
                administrator, and this is a 32-bit system, the directory should be C:\Program
                Files\AppInventor\commands-for-Appinventor, or Program Files (x86) for a 64-bit
                system.
        </li>
        <li>
         Type the "dir" command and check that one of the files listed is adb.exe. If
                it's not, then you are in the wrong directory or the software didn't install.
        </li>
        <li>
         Plug your phone into one of your computer's USB slots, making sure that the
                phone shows USB connected and USB debugging connected.
        </li>
        <li>
         Type the command "adb devices". You should see the messages "daemon not
                running" followed by "daemon stated successfully", followed by "list of devices
                attached". If there is a device in the list, something like HT99TP800054, then the
                phone is connected and the computer and the phone can communicate and the drivers
                should be OK.
        </li>
        <li>
         On the other hand, if the list of devices is blank, you'll have to get
                additional drivers, or install the existing drivers manually.
         <blockquote class="notice">
          Try unplugging and replugging the phone into your computer and trying the "adb
                    devices" command again before getting or installing device drivers, as
                    sometimes that is sufficient to make the connection work.

       <h2>
        Installing the App Inventor Setup drivers manually:
       </h2>
       <p>
        The AppInventor Setup software includes the
        <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/win-usb.html">
         Google USB driver
        </a>
        , as noted
                above. If your device is one of the ones that the driver handles, the drivers
                should have been installed automatically, and the driver installation should check
                out as described above.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the check fails, and you need to install the Google drivers manually. You can
                find instructions
        <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/win-usb.html#InstallingDriver">
         here
        </a>
        . In
                following the instructions, note that you do not need to install the SDK or
                download the drivers again Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; they were included with the App Inventor Setup
                software, and you can find them in the App Inventor software directory in the
                usb_driver sub-folder of the appinventor-setup folder where the installer placed
                the software, for example C:\Program
                Files\AppInventor\commands-for-Appinventor\usb_driver.
       </p>
       <p>
        The directions for installing the Google USB drivers may also help if you have
                trouble with a manufacturer's driver, but in general, you might need to search on
                the Web for help in the various Android developer forums.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Other issues
       </h2>
       <p>
        If the drivers are installed, and you see the phone listed by "adb devices", but
                App Inventor still won't connect, then you should ask in the
        <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/appinventor">
         App Inventor Forum
        </a>
        . Some devices
                may require special extra steps, or there may be some other issue. If you find (or
                solve) issues with other devices, please post to the Forum so that other App
                Inventor users can benefit from your experience.
