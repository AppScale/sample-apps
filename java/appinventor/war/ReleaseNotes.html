                <h2>Release Notes</h2>

                <h3>Version 133, February 5, 2013</h3>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    You will need to upgrade your copy of the MIT
                    AICompanion for this release. Look for version
                    2.05 in the Google Play
                    Store. <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/releaseupdate"
                    target="_blank">[More Information]</a>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Updated Texting Component. The property
                    “ReceivingEnabled” is no longer a boolean but is
                    instead a numeric value. 1 = receiving disabled. 2
                    = Receiving enabled, but only when the app is
                    running. 3 = Receiving enabled, both when the app
                    is running and when it isn’t (in which case a
                    notification is displayed, as it does for the v132
                    release). So 1 is the equivalent to “false” in the
                    old release and 3 is equivalent to “true” and 2 is
                    a new option which emulates the behavior of the
                    old texting component (prior to release v129)
                    where texts could be received only when the app
                    was running.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    New Button Press Behavior: When an image is set as
                    a button background, it will change color
                    (lighten) when pressed in order to give the user
                    feedback that the button was pressed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Disable Horizontal/Vertical and Alignment
                    properties for HorizontalArrangement and Vertical
                    Arrangment in designer when width/length is
                    automatic.  Disable Vertical Alignment for Screen
                    when Scrollable is set.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added logic to ShowChooseDialog & ShowTexDialog
                    methods to include a Cancel button based on a new
                    arg to indicate cancelable state.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Incorporation of the “Bugsense” Error reporting
                    system in the MIT AICompanion App. This system
                    will report bugs directly back to MIT.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Bugfixes.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Version 132, December 12, 2012</h3>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Wireless Access to App Inventor. The new <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.mit.appinventor.aicompanion2" target="_blank">MIT
                    AICompanion</a> App, available at the Google Play Store
                    and for <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/download/" target="_blank">direct downloading</a>, may be used to develop
                    App Inventor Apps instead of using a USB Cable to
                    connect your phone. All that is needed is a
                    wireless (WiFi) network accessible to both the
                    phone and the PC used for development.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Version 131, December 10, 2012</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Image Picker is updated to permit selecting images
                    both from the camera and from other Photo Albums
                    accessible from the device.  It also copies the
                    selected image to a file on the SD card and
                    returns the path to that file as it's “image”
                    argument to AfterPicking.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Camcorder component: Minor modification to where
                    recorded videos are stored. Now stored in the
                    Camcorder default location.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Bugfixes and Cleanup work on the Texting Component.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Fix to buildserver that on occasion resulted in
                    packages that required external libraries (such as
                    Texting and Fusion Tables) to not have the correct
                    libraries included. Note: This was fixed in v130c
                    patch release as well.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Notifier component fixed to display reasonable
                    sized fonts on both older and newer versions of
                    Android.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Version 130, November 9, 2012</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Migrated FusiontablesControl to the new V1 API library.<p>
                    The implementation follows V1 migration guide:<br>
                    https://developers.google.com/fusiontables/docs/v1/migration_guide
                    <p>
                    The main changes are:
                    <ul>
                      <li>The API has a new URL: https://www.googleapis.com/fusiontables/v1/query</li>
                      <li>Oauth 2.0 authentication is used with an API key. Developers must now
                        register with Google and get an API key.</li>
                      <li>The Google AccountManager is used to select an account and obtain
                        an access_token that is used in all queries. (Similar to old approach)</li>
                      <li>Google API client libraries are used in the implementation.</li>
                      <li>All queries use the client library's Sql object to make the actual requests.
                        This is similar to the deprecated version.</li>
                      <li>A new method, SendQuery, is added to perform API v1 requests. The updated
                        FusiontablesControl is backwards compatible. Previously written
                        applications, using DoQuery, will still work until the end of the year.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Modified Texting component.<p>
                    The main changes are:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Now works with Wifi. This solution using Google Voice. It requires
                        users to sign up online for Google Voice and to download and install
                        the Google Voice mobile application. The mobile application is used
                        for incoming messages. For outgoing messages the application uses
                        Google AccountManager to authenticate the user and then uses their
                        Google Voice account to send messages.</li>
                      <li>Applications that include the revised component can receive text messages
                          even when they are not running, with the user being notified on the status
                          bar of incoming messages.</li>
                      <li>Component now uses OAuth2Helper, same as used in FusiontablesControl.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                  </li>
                  <li>Updated Twitter component with latest version of
                    twitter4j. Fixing bug that makes some numerical replies
                    from Twitter fail.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added zipalign tool to the packaging process allowing
                    applications to be placed in the play store.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added Progress bar, allowing for the monitoring of the
                    application build process.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Modified the Blockseditor so that it now connects and works with the
                    Samsung Galaxy S III.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Fixed Full Screen Video to work with older android versions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added speed and heading to callback for Sprite.Flung and Canvas.flung.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added transition animations to screens.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added caching of Message of the Day messages.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We also made minor User Interface improvements and bugfixes.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Version 129, September 11, 2012</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Resize-able and Full Screen Video support. You
                    can now resize an existing Video Player component
                    from the blocks editor. In Android 2.0+ you can set
                    a Video Player to use the entire phone's screen. The
                    &lt;back&gt; key will restore it to its original
                    size.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Horizontal and Vertical Arrangements can now align
                    their contents. Arrangements and Screens can now
                    align their contents along Left, Right, Center,
                    Top and Bottom edges.<br />
                    These settings have no effect if the arrangement
                    size is set to automatic, and vertical setting has
                    no effect if the screen is scrollable.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Canvas and Sprite Improvements. The new events
                    "Flung", "TouchUP" and "TouchDown" have been added
                    to Sprites and Canvases. When a user touches a
                    Sprite and then quickly swipes their finger in
                    some direction, a "Flung" event is issued for the
                    Sprite which gives the direction and speed of the
                    swipe. This can be used to determine the direction
                    and relative speed to move a Sprite. Canvases also
                    receive a Flung event so a user can perform the
                    swiping (Fling) motion anywhere on a Canvas and
                    the MIT App Inventor programmer can decide how to
                    handle it.<br />
                    When a user places their finger on a Sprite, a
                    TouchDown event is now triggered. When they lift
                    their finger a TouchUP event is triggered. These
                    events are in addition to the existing "Touched"
                    event.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added new screen orientation settings: (1) User
                    (let's the app's user select portrait or
                    landscape; and (2) Sensor (auto-rotates as the
                    phone rotates)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We also made minor User Interface improvements and bugfixes.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Version 128, August 6, 2012</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Minor bugfixes associated with building from sources.</li>
                  <li>Added code to map account e-mail addresses. A special configuration file (fixids) is used
                    to map Google Email addresses to other Google Email Addresses. This is used to fix some people
                    who have mixed case letters in their email addresses when in the past they didn't.</li>
                  <li>
                    The Blocks editor is now signed with a public CA issued certificate. People should no longer see a warning dialog box from Java that they have to click past.</li>
                  <li>
                    Added more detailed logging to the build server.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Version 127, July 24, 2012</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Added a Camcorder component. It works similarly to the Camera component but captures Video instead of photos.<br />
                    <ul>
                      <li>Known Issue: If you play back a recorded video, it will be very small. This will be fixed in an upcoming release.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Allow Image Sprites to rotate and resize simultaneously.</li>
                  <li>Bugfix in Webviewer component where it could under certain circumstances get a null pointer exception.</li>
                  <li>Permit Application's versionName and versionCode to be edited in the Designer as a property of the Screen1 component. This is necessary to permit updating of applications submitted to the Google Play Store.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Version 126, June 26, 2012</h3>
                <ul>
                        <li> Upgrading the Player Component - Added a Completed event, an isPlaying method, a Looping and Volume property. Modified the Stop method to seek back to the beginning of the song.</li>
                        <li> Updated Player Component Documentation.</li>
                        <li> Added new flag to the launch-buildserer script allowing the ability to specify log file and output path.</li>
                        <li> Added a link to the main panel for access to Release Notes.</li>
                        <li> Updated text in Quizme tutorial.</li>
                        <li> Added check for invalid file names.</li>
                        <li> Modify LocationSensor component to include designer properties for time and distance notification intervals.</li>
                        <li> Cleaned up misleading warning and error messages.</li>
                        <li> Updated documentation on how to restart the app from the blocks editor.</li>
                        <li> Added new property, MinimumInterval, to accelerometer, that keeps it from reporting Shaking events too often.</li>
