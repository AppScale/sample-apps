If you want to package your apps into .apks, you must run the local build server on each AppScale server node on localhost:8080. For instructions on this, see this link: "https://code.google.com/p/app-inventor-releases/wiki/BuildingAndRunning" (specifically the instruction with RunLocalBuildServer). Make sure you check out the newblocks branch in App Inventor's github to do this.
