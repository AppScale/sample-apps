        QuizMe is a trivia game about baseball, but you can use it as a template to build
                quizzes on any topic. With QuizMe:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         The user steps through a series of questions, clicking a button to proceed to
                the next question.
        </li>
        <li>
         The user enters an answer for each question and the app reports whether each
                answer is correct or not.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        With QuizMe, the quiz questions are always the same unless you, the programmer,
                change them. Later, you can create
        <a href="/learn/tutorials/makequiztakequiz/makequiztakequiz.html">
         MakeQuiz
        </a>
        , an app that
                lets users of the app create and modify the quiz questions.
       </p>
       <p>
        This tutorial assumes you are familiar with the basics of App Inventor -- using the
                Component Designer to build a user interface, and using the Blocks Editor to
                specify event-handlers. If you are not familiar with the basics, try stepping
                through some of the
        <a href="/learn/tutorials/index.html">
         basic tutorials
        </a>
        before continuing.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Getting Started
       </h2>
       <p>
        Connect to the App Inventor web site and start a new project. Name it QuizMe, and
                also set the screen's
        <span class="ButtonText">
         Title
        </span>
        to QuizMe. Open the
                Blocks Editor and connect to the phone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also download these pictures of baseball players and save them on your
                computer:
        <a href="QuizMeAssets/Larsenberra.jpg">
         Larsenberra.jpg
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="QuizMeAssets/dallasbraden.jpg">
         dallasbraden.jpg
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="QuizMeAssets/cyyoung.jpg">
         cyyoung.jpg
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="QuizMeAssets/nolanryan.jpg">
         nolanryan.jpg
        </a>
        . Later, you'll load these images
                into your project.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Introduction
       </h2>
       <p>
        You'll design the quiz game so that the user proceeds from question to question by
                clicking a Next button, and receives simple correct/incorrect feedback on each
                answer.
       </p>
       <p>
        This tutorial introduces:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Defining and displaying lists of information
        </li>
        <li>
         Sequencing through a list using an index variable -- a variable that keeps
                track of a position in a list.
        </li>
        <li>
         Conditional behaviors-- performing certain operations only when a condition is
                met.
        </li>
        <li>
         Switching an image to show a different picture at different times.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <h2>
        Set up the Components
       </h2>
       <p>
        Use the component designer to create the interface for QuizMe. When you finish, it
                should look something like the snapshot below (there are also more detailed
                instructions below the snapshot).
       </p>
       <div class="imagecontainer">
        <img alt="" height="515" src="QuizMeAssets/designer.png" width="950" />
       </div>
       <p>
        To create this interface, first load the images you downloaded into the project.
                Click on the
        <span class="ButtonText">
         Add
        </span>
        button in the
        <span class="ButtonText">
         Media
        </span>
        area and select one of the downloaded files (e.g.,
        <span class="ButtonText">
         Larsenberra.jpg
        </span>
        ). Then do the same for the other
                three images.
       </p>
       <p>
        Next, create the following components by dragging them from the
        <span class="ButtonText">
         Palette
        </span>
        into the
        <span class="ButtonText">
         Viewer
        </span>
        .

        To start, you'll ignore the answers and just work on the behavior to sequence

                the first question should appear in the label named
        <span class="ButtonText">
         QuestionLabel

        <span class="ButtonText">
         NextButton
        </span>
        , the second question should appear. When the user
                clicks again, the third should appear. When the last question is reached, clicking
                the
        <span class="ButtonText">
         NextButton
        </span>
        should result in the first question
                once again appearing in the

      </div>
      <h2>
       How the Blocks Work
      </h2>
      <p>
       The first row of blocks increments the variable
       <span class="ButtonText">
        currentQuestionIndex
       </span>
       . If
       <span class="ButtonText">
        currentQuestionIndex
       </span>
       has a 1 in it, it is changed to 2. If it has
              a 2, it is changed to 3, and so on. Once the
       <span class="ButtonText">
        currentQuestionIndex
       </span>
       variable has been changed, the app uses it
              to select the
       <em>
        "
       </em>
       current
       <em>
        "
       </em>
       question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recall that in the
       <span class="ButtonText">
        Screen.Initialize
       </span>
       event-handler,
              the app selected the first question to display:
      </p>
      <div class="imagecontainer">
       <img alt="" border="0" src="QuizMeAssets/selectFirst.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="c4">
       <p>
        When the
        <span class="ButtonText">
         NextButton
        </span>
        is clicked, the app doesn't
                choose the first item in the list, or the 2nd or 3rd, it chooses the
        <span class="ButtonText">
         currentQuestionIndex
        </span>
        <em class="c3">
         th

      <div class="imagecontainer">
       <img alt="" src="QuizMeAssets/chooseCurrent.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
       The blocks are executed in a right-to-left manner. The app first evaluates the
       <span class="ButtonText">
        index
       </span>
       parameter of
       <span class="ButtonText">
        select
              list item
       </span>
       , which is the variable
       <span class="ButtonText">
        currentQuestionIndex
       </span>
       . The number is stored in
       <span class="ButtonText">
        currentQuestionIndex
       </span>
       is used as the index when the select list
              item is executed.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the
       <span class="ButtonText">
        NextButton
       </span>
       is clicked for the first time,
              the increment blocks will set
       <span class="ButtonText">
        currentQuestionIndex
       </span>
       from 1 to 2, so the app will select the second item from
       <span class="ButtonText">
        QuestionList
       </span>
       , "who pitched the first perfect game of 2010?". The

       <span class="ButtonText">

       is clicked,
       <span class="ButtonText">

       will be set from 2 to 3, and the app will
              select the 3rd question in the list, "who pitched the first perfect game of the
              modern era?"
      </p>

      <p>
       The problem with the app is that it
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       increments the
       <span class="ButtonText">
        currentQuestionIndex

       variable when the
       <span class="ButtonText">

       </span>
       is clicked.&nbsp; When
       <span class="ButtonText">
        currentQuestionIndex
       </span>
       is already 3 and the user clicks the
              NextButton, the app changes
       <span class="ButtonText">
        currentQuestionIndex
       </span>
       from
              3 to 4, then calls select list item to get the
       <span class="ButtonText">
        currentQuestionIndex
       </span>
       <em class="c3">
        th

       , or in this case, the
              4th item. Since there are only three items in the variable
       <span class="ButtonText">
        QuestionList
       </span>
       , Android complains.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the app needs to do is ask a question-- check a condition-- when the
       <span class="ButtonText">
        NextButton
       </span>
       is clicked, and execute different blocks
              dependending on the answer. One way to ask the question is to ask, "is the variable
       <span class="ButtonText">
        currentQuestionIndex
       </span>
       already 3?" If the answer is
              yes, you should set
       <span class="ButtonText">
        currentQuestionIndex
       </span>
       back to 0 so
              the user is taken back to the first question.

       When the
       <span class="ButtonText">
        NextButton
       </span>
       is clicked, the app first checks

       <span class="ButtonText">
        currentQuestionIndex
       </span>
       has a 3 in it. If it

       <span class="ButtonText">

       </span>
       is set back to 0 so that
              when 1 is added to it with the blocks below, it will be 1 and the quiz will loop back
              to display the first question. Note that only the blocks inset within the
       <span class="ButtonText">

       . Because variables like currentQuestionIndex are
              hidden, they are often the source of bugs in a program. Fortunately, App Inventor
              provides a way to make such hidden variables transparent during testing.
              Specifically, App Inventor allows you to "watch" how the value of a variable change
              as an app progresses. For this test, right-click the currentQuestionIndex def block
              in the Blocks Editor and choose
       <em>
        Watch
       </em>
       . Then choose
       <span class="ButtonText">
        Restart Phone App
       </span>
       The def block will then appear with a watch box
              showing the initial value of currentQuestionIndex (1):
       <div class="imagecontainer">
        <img alt="" src="QuizMeAssets/watchindex1.png" />
       </div>
       <p>
        Now pick up the phone and click the NextButon. The second question, "who pitched
                the most recent perfect game in the major leagues?" should appear in the
                QuestionLabel on the phone, as before. On the App Inventor screen, 2 should appear
                in the currentQuestionIndex memory cell:
       </p>
       <div class="imagecontainer">
        <img alt="" src="QuizMeAssets/watchindex2.png" />
       </div>
       <p>
        When you click again, the third question should appear on the phone and 3 should
                appear in the memory cell . If you click again, 1 should appear in
                currentQuestionIndex and the first question on the phone.

      <h2>
       A Maintainable App: Making it Easy to Modify the Questions
      </h2>
      <p>
       Next, you'll modify the app to make it easy to add and remove elements from the list.
              You'll rewrite the blocks so that they'll work on any list, not just one with exactly
              three items. To begin, add a fourth question to
       <span class="ButtonText">
        QuestionList
       </span>
       and another answer into
       <span class="ButtonText">
        AnswerList

       . The blocks should look like this:
      </p>
      <div class="imagecontainer">
       <img alt="" height="325" src="QuizMeAssets/listsWith4.png" width="667" />

       . Click the
       <span class="ButtonText">
        NextButton
       </span>
       a number of times. You should see that the fourth
              question never appears, no matter how many times you click
       <span class="ButtonText">
        Next
       </span>
       .
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The problem is that the test to see if the user is on the last question is too
              specific: it asks if the
       <span class="ButtonText">
        currentQuestionIndex
       </span>
       variable is 3:
      </p>
      <div class="imagecontainer">
       <img alt="" border="0" src="QuizMeAssets/if3.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
       You could just change the number 3 to a 4, and the app would again work correctly.
              The problem with this solution, however, is that each time you modify the questions
              and answers, you also have to remember to make this change. Such dependencies in a
              computer program often lead to bugs, especially as an app grows in complexity. It's
              much better to set the program up so that it will work no matter how many questions
              there are. Such generality is even more important when the list you are working with
              changes dynamically, e.g., a quiz app that allows the user to add new questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The better solution is to ask the question in a more general way. You really want to
              know if the current question the user is on-- the value of
       <span class="ButtonText">
        currentQuestionIndex
       </span>
       -- is as large as the number of items in
       <span class="ButtonText">
        QuestionList
       </span>
       . If the app asks the question in this
              more general manner, it will work even when you add to or remove items from the
              QuestionList. To modify the
       <span class="ButtonText">
        NextButton.Click
       </span>
       event-handler you'll replace the previous test that referred directly to 3. You'll
              need the following blocks:

       The

       has a 4 in it, and the length of the

       will be set to 0 (and then 1 after the
              increment operation in the first row of blocks after the if). Note that, because the
              blocks no longer refer to 3 or any specific size, the behavior will work no matter
              how many items are in the list.

       When you click the NextButton, does the

              fourth?
      </blockquote>
      <h2>
       Switching the Image for Each Question
      </h2>
      <p>
       The current app shows the same image, no matter what question is being asked. You can
              change this so an image pertaining to each question appears when the
       <span class="ButtonText">
        NextButton
       </span>
       is clicked. Earlier, you added four pictures as media
              for the project. Now, you'll create a third list,
       <span class="ButtonText">
        PictureList
       </span>
       , with the names of the image files as its items. and
              you'll modify the
       <span class="ButtonText">
        NextButton.Click
       </span>
       event-handler to
              switch the picture each time.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, create a
       <span class="ButtonText">
        PictureList
       </span>
       and initialize it with
              the names of the image files. Be sure that the names are exactly the same as the
              names of the files that were loaded in to the media of the project. Here's how the
              blocks for the
       <span class="ButtonText">
        PictureList
       </span>
       should look:
      </p>
      <div class="imagecontainer">
       <img alt="" src="QuizMeAssets/pictureList.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
       Next, you need to modify the
       <span class="ButtonText">
        NextButton.Click
       </span>
       event-handler so that it modifies the picture depending on what question the user is
              on. If you set the
       <span class="ButtonText">
        Image.Picture
       </span>
       property to a file
              name of an image that has been loaded, that image will appear. To modify
       <span class="ButtonText">
        NextButton.Click
       </span>
       , you'll need the following blocks:

      </div>
      <h2>

      <p>
       The
       <span class="ButtonText">
        currentQuestionIndex
       </span>
       serves as the index for the
       <span class="ButtonText">

       </span>
       and the
       <span class="ButtonText">

       . When
       <span class="ButtonText">
        currentQuestionIndex
       </span>
       is 1, the app selects the first question and
              the first picture. When
       <span class="ButtonText">
        currentQuestionIndex
       </span>
       is 2,
              the app selects the second question and second picture. Of course this scheme depends
              on the lists being in sync and indeed they are. For instance, the first picture,
       <span class="ButtonText">
        LarsenBerra.jpg
       </span>
       is a picture of Don Larsen, and Don
              Larsen is the answer to the first question, "Who pitched a perfect game in the World
              Series?" Test the modified behavior. Does a different image appear each time you
              click the NextButton?
      </p>
      <h2>
       Evaluating Answers
      </h2>
      <p>
       Next, you'll add blocks that report whether the user has answered a question
              correctly or not. The user enters the answer in
       <span class="ButtonText">
        AnswerText
       </span>
       and then clicks the
       <span class="ButtonText">
        AnswerButton
       </span>
       . The app must compare the user's entry with the
              answer to the "current" question, using an
       <span class="ButtonText">
        ifelse
       </span>
       block to check. The
       <span class="ButtonText">
        RightWrongLabel
       </span>
       should be
              modified to report whether or not the answer is correct. You'll need the following
              blocks for this behavior:

       When the
       <span class="ButtonText">
        NextButton
       </span>
       is clicked, the user is
              moving on to the next question, so the top two rows of the event-handler blank out
              the
       <span class="ButtonText">
        RightWrongLabel
       </span>

       <h2>
        Variations
       </h2>
       <p>
        Once you get a quiz working, you might want to explore some variations. For
                example,
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Instead of just showing images for each question, try playing a sound clip or a
                short video. With sound, you can turn your quiz app into a
         <em>
          Name That Tune
         </em>
         app.
        </li>
        <li>
         The quiz is very rigid in terms of what is accepted as a valid answer. There
                are a number of ways to modify this. One is to use the text.contains block to see
                if the user's answer is contained in the actual answer. Another is to provide
                multiple answers for each question, and check by iterating (
         <span class="ButtonText">
          foreach
         </span>
         ) through them to see if any match.
        </li>
        <li>
         Transform the quiz so that it is multiple-choice. The list of answers will need
                to be a list of lists, with each sub-list holding the answer choices. Use the
         <span class="ButtonText">
          ListPicker
         </span>
         component to allow the user to choose an
                answer.
        </li>
       </ul>

        Review
       </h2>
       Here are some of the ideas covered in this tutorial:
       <ul>
        <li>
         Apps can be written in a general manner so that they work with any data list.
        </li>
        <li>
         Index variables are used to track the current position within a list . When you
                increment them, be careful about reaching the end of the list.
        </li>
       </ul>
