          PaintPot lets you scribble in different colors by touching the screen to draw
                    dots and lines. Concepts introduced in this project include: Canvas components
                    for drawing; event handlers that take arguments, including touch and drag
                    events; and Arrangement components for controlling screen layout.

          In the arcade game Whac-a-Mole
          <sup>
           TM
          </sup>
          , a "mole" pops up at random
                    positions on a playing field, and the user score points by hitting the mole
                    with a mallet. This is a similar game that uses the touchscreen. This tutorial
                    introduces: image sprites, timers, and procedures.

          PicCall illustrates how to create applications that use the phone's
                    functionality. This application lets you select people from your contact list
                    and display their pictures. When you press a picture picture, the phone calls
                    that person.

          QuizMe is a trivia game about baseball, but you can use it as a template to
                    build quizzes on any topic. With QuizMe the user steps through a series of
                    questions, clicking a Next button to proceed to the next question. The user
                    enters an answer for each question and the app reports whether each answer is
                    correct or not. For this tutorial, you'll create an app in which the questions
                    are always the same unless you, the programmer, change them. Later, you can
                    create MakeAQuiz, an app that lets users create and modify the quiz questions.

          MakeQuiz and TakeQuiz are two apps that, in tandem, allow a teacher to create
                    quizzes for a student. Parents can create fun trivia aps for their children
                    during a long road trip, grade school teachers can build "Math Blaster"
                    quizzes, and college students can build quizzes to help their study groups
                    prepare for a final. This tutorial will walk you through creating both the
                    MakeQuiz and the TakeQuiz app.

          This is a two-part tutorial introduces the ActivityStarter component for
                    launching arbitrary Android Apps and the ListPicker component for allowing a
                    user to choose from a list of items. You'll build MapTour, an app for visiting
                    French vacation destinations with a single click. Users of your app will be
                    able to visit the Eiffel Tower, the Lourve, and Notre Dame in quick succession.

          This tutorial extends the Text Group tutorial. That app sent a text to a fixed
                    list of phone numbers, and only the programmer could change the numbers in the
                    list. The app in this tutorial allows the user to add and remove the phone
                    numbers in the list, and it stores the list persistently in a database.

          In this tutorial, you'll write an app that automatically responds to texts
                    messages and broadcasts texts messages it receives to a list of phone
                    numbers.The app is inspired by FrontLineSMS, a tool that has been used in
                    developing countries to monitor elections, broadcast weather changes, and in
                    general connect people that don't have access to the web but do have phones and
                    mobile connectivity.

          This tutorial demonstrates how an app can respond to text messages
                    automatically. You'll build an app that sends back a response when a text
                    message is received. The idea for the app came from University of San Franciso
                    student Daniel Finnegan.

                    2

          <br />
          You know that texting while driving is dangerous, so you've created and
                    installed the No Text While Driving app on your phone. Now, when you drive you
                    open that app and let it auto-respond to incoming texts. But the jingle of the
                    texts coming in is killing you with curiosity-- wouldn't it be great if you
                    could hear the texts spoken aloud? With Part II of the tutorial, you'll extend
                    the app so that it speaks out both the message and who sent it. And since
                    you're making some changes anyway, you'll modify the auto-response so it
                    reports your whereabouts in the reply: "Sorry, I'm driving and I'm at 1600
                    Pennsylvania Avenue". Before completing this tutorial you should complete part
                    I.

          <br />
          You parked somewhere near the stadium or bar, but when the concert/party ends
                    you don't have a clue where the car is. The friends you came with are equally
                    as clueless. Fortunately you haven't lost your Android phone that never forgets
                    anything, and you remember you have the hot new app, Android, Where's My Car?.
                    With this app, you click a button when you park your car, and the Android uses
                    its location sensor to record the car's GPS coordinates and address. Later,
                    when you reopen the app, it shows you a map from where you are to the
                    remembered location-- problem solved! With this tutorial you'll be able to
                    download a created app and then study the annotated blocks below to better
                    understand the app and App Inventor programming in general.
