       <h1>
        Building your first app (Part 2): Completing HelloPurr
       </h1>
       <p>
        Now that you've set up your computer and device, and you've learned how the
                Designer and the Blocks Editor work, you are ready to complete the HelloPurr app.
                At this point, you should have the Designer open in your browser, the Blocks Editor
                open in another window, and your chosen device (phone or emulator) connected to the
                Blocks Editor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here's a preview of the steps you'll do in this tutorial to complete the app:
       </p>
       <b>
        In the Designer:
       </b>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Add a
         <em>
          Label
         </em>
         component that reads "Pet the Kitty".
        </li>
        <li>
         Upload the meow.mp3 file
        </li>
        <li>
         Add a
         <em>
          Sound
         </em>
         component that plays the meow.mp3 file.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <b>
        In the Blocks Editor:
       </b>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Create an
         <i>
          event handler
         </i>
         that tells the Sound component to play when the
                user taps the button.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <h2>
        Adding the label
       </h2>
       <p class="c2">
        Under
        <em>
         Palette
        </em>
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         Drag and drop the
         <span class="ButtonText">
          Label
         </span>
         component to the
         <em>
          Viewer
         </em>
         , placing it below the kitty. It will appear under your list of
                components as
         <i>
          Label1
         </i>
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p class="c2">
        Under
        <em>
         Properties
        </em>
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         Change the Text property of Label1 to read "Pet the Kitty". You'll see the text
                change in the Designer and on your device.
        </li>
        <li>
         Change the BackgroundColor of Label1 by clicking on the box
        </li>
        <li>
         Change the TextColor of Label1
        </li>
        <li>
         Change the FontSize of Label1 to 30
        </li>
       </ol>
       The Designer should now look like this:
       <div class="imagecontainer">
        <img alt="" src="/learn/tutorials/hellopurr/HelloPurrAssets/kittybluebutton.png" width="760" />
       </div>
       <h2>
        Adding the meow sound
       </h2>
       <p class="c2">
        Under
        <em>
         Palette
        </em>
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         Click on the header marked
         <span class="ButtonText">
          Media
         </span>
         to expand the
                Media section of the palette of components.
        </li>
        <li>
         Drag out a
         <span class="ButtonText">
          Sound
         </span>
         component and place it in the
         <em>
          Viewer
         </em>
         . Wherever you drop it, it will appear in the area at the bottom of
                the
         <em>
          Viewer
         </em>
         marked
         <span class="ButtonText">
          Non-visible components
         </span>
         .
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p class="c2">
        Under
        <em>
         Media
        </em>
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         Click
         <span class="ButtonText">
          Add...
         </span>
        </li>
        <li>
         Upload the meow.mp3 file to this project.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p class="c2">
        Under
        <em>
         Properties
        </em>
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         For the
         <span class="ButtonText">
          Sound1
         </span>
         component, set its
         <span class="ButtonText">
          Source
         </span>
         to meow.mp3.
        </li>
       </ol>
       The Designer should now look like this:
       <div class="imagecontainer">
        <img alt="" src="/learn/tutorials/hellopurr/HelloPurrAssets/kittybluebuttonsound.png" width="760" />
       </div>
       <h2>
        Making the sound play
       </h2>
       <p>
        Using the Blocks Editor we will define how the app is going to behave. We'll tell
                the components what to do, and when to do it. You're going to tell the kitty button
                to play a sound when the user taps it. If components are ingredients in a recipe,
                you can think of blocks as the cooking instructions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Blocks Editor has two tabs on the upper left hand corner:
        <span class="ButtonText">
         Built-in
        </span>
        and
        <span class="ButtonText">
         My Blocks
        </span>
        . The
                buttons under each tab expand and expose blocks when clicked. The
        <span class="ButtonText">
         Built-in
        </span>
        blocks are the standard set of blocks that are
                available for every app you build. The blocks under
        <span class="ButtonText">
         My
                Blocks
        </span>
        contain specific blocks that are tied to the set of components that
                you have chosen for your app.
       </p>
       <p>
        To make the sound play, you'll need to drag and drop the
        <span class="ButtonText">
         Button1.Click
        </span>
        block and the
        <span class="ButtonText">
         Sound1.Play
        </span>
        block into the editor. The blocks connect together
                like puzzle pieces.
       </p>
       <h4>
        Steps for making the sound play
       </h4>
       <ol>
        <li>
         Navigate to the
         <em>
          Blocks Editor
         </em>
         . It may be covered up by the web
                browser.
        </li>
        <li>
         Click the
         <span class="ButtonText">
          My Blocks
         </span>
         tab at the top left hand
                side.
        </li>
        <li>
         Click
         <span class="ButtonText">
          Button1
         </span>
         .
        </li>
        <li>
         Drag and drop the
         <span class="Block">
          when Button1.Click do
         </span>
         block onto
                the editor.
        </li>
        <li>
         Click
         <span class="ButtonText">
          Sound1
         </span>
         .
        </li>
        <li>
         Drag the
         <span class="Block">
          call Sound1.Play
         </span>
         block onto the editor and
                drop it into the
         <span class="Block">
          when Button1.Click do
         </span>
         block.
        </li>
        <li>
         Click the kitty picture on your device. You should hear the kitty meow.
        </li>
       </ol>
       Your Blocks Editor should look like this:
       <div class="imagecontainer">
        <img alt="" src="/learn/tutorials/hellopurr/HelloPurrAssets/blockseditorwithblocks.png" width="760" />
       </div>
       <h2>
        Packaging your app
       </h2>
       <p>
        Congratulations, your first app is running! If you're using a phone, then the app
                is running on the phone, but it runs only while the phone is connected to App
                Inventor. If you unplug the USB cord, the app will vanish. You can reconnect the
                phone to make it come back. To get an that app runs without being connected to App
                Inventor, you must "package" the app to produce an
        <em>
         application package
        </em>
        (apk file). Pressing
        <span class="ButtonText">
         Package for Phone
        </span>
        at the upper
                right of the designer page will present three options for packaging:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         If the phone is connected, you can download and automatically install the app
                on your phone.
        </li>
        <li>
         You can download the app to your computer as an apk file, which you can
                distribute and share as you like, and manually install on phones using the Android
                ADB program.
        </li>
        <li>
         You can generate a Barcode, which you can use to install the app on your phone
                with the aid of a barcode scanner, like the ZXing barcode scanner (freely available
                in the Android Market). This barcode works only for your own phone. If you want to
                share the app with others, you'll need to download the apk file to your computer
                and share the file.
        </li>
       </ol>

        Review
       </h2>
       <p>
        Here are the key ideas covered so far:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <p>
          You build apps by selecting components (ingredients) and then telling them what
                    to do and when to do it.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          You use the
          <em>
           Designer
          </em>
          to select components. Some components are visible
                    and some aren't.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          You can add media (sounds and images) to apps by uploading them from your
                    computer.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          You use the Blocks Editor to assemble blocks that define the components'
                    behavior
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          <span class="block">
           when ... do ...
          </span>
          blocks define
          <em>
           event
                    handlers
          </em>
          , that tell components what to do
          <em>
           when
          </em>
          something happens.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          <span class="block">
           call ...
          </span>
          blocks tell components to do things.
         </p>
        </li>
       </ul>
