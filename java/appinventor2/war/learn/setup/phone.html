        Set up your Android phone

       <p>
        In this section, we'll make sure your phone is ready for you to use with App
                Inventor. This involves checking a few settings and making sure they're set the
                right way, then connecting the phone to your computer with a USB cable. If you have
                a Windows machine, then you may also need to install a driver for the phone.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Compatible phones
       </h2>
       <p>
        There are hundreds of different Android phone models, and new ones are appearing
                all the time. Even
        <i>
         we
        </i>
        don't know about all of them. Here are a few of the
                phones that are being used successfully with App Inventor:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Google: Nexus One, Nexus S
        </li>
        <li>
         Motorola: Droid, Droid X, Droid Incredible
        </li>
        <li>
         T-Mobile: G1
        </li>
        <li>
         HTC: Incredible, Hero, Desire, â&euro;Ś
        </li>
       </ul>
       Note, however, that some of these phones will require the installation of
              drivers to work with Windows computers.
       <p>
        Whichever model you have, your phone must have an SD card installed, or else it
                won't work with App Inventor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if your Android phone isn't on this list, it's still likely to work with App
                Inventor, but we can't say for sure. Follow the instructions on this page, and if
                you have any problems, see the
        <a href="../troubleshooting.html">
         troubleshooting
                page
        </a>
        , or search the
        <a href="/forum/">
         App
                Inventor User Forum
        </a>
        under "Getting set up and connecting your phone" for advice
                from others who may be using the same phone.

        Check your settings
       </h2>
       <p>
        To get your phone ready to work with App Inventor, follow these steps:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         Tap the Home button to go to your phone's Home screen.
        </li>
        <li>
         Tap the Menu button, then Settings, then Applications.
        </li>
        <li>
         If your phone has an Unknown sources setting, make sure it is checked.
         <div class="c2">
          <img alt="" src="StartingAssets/unknownsources.png" width="200" />
         </div>
        </li>
        <li>
         Tap Development.
        </li>
        <li>
         Make sure both USB Debugging and Stay Awake are checked.
         <div class="c2">
          <img alt="" src="StartingAssets/usbdebugging.png" width="200" />
         </div>
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        If your phone is on the lock screen, unlock it as you would to get ready to run an
                app. Now get your USB cable and connect the phone to the computer. Two status
                messages appear on the phone in the notifications area at the top of the screen:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         USB Connected means the phone is connected to the computer.
        </li>
        <li>
         USB Debugging Connected allows the App Inventor on the computer to control the
                phone.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <h2>
