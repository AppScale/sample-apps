        I'm running on a Mac and I'm having various Java problems.
       </b>
       <p>
        If you are using a Mac, we recommend that you use JRE 1.6 (Java 6). Many Macs have
                both Java 5 and Java 6 installed but are configured to use Java 5 by default. You
                can change that default to Java 6 with the following steps:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         In the Finder, open the Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Java folder.
        </li>
        <li>
         Run Java Preferences.
        </li>
        <li>
         Select the General tab.
        </li>
        <li>
         You'll see two version lists Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; one for Java applets and one for Java
                applications. In each list, drag the "Java SE 6" to the top of the list.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        If your Mac doesn't have 1.6 installed, Java 1.5 should work, but 1.6 is preferred.

        The Blocks Editor won't open: Java reports a "security exception".
       </b>
       <p>
        This error is probably not specific to App Inventor: there's a good chance you
                can't run any Java programs from the browser. One common cause is that your Java
                system is expecting to connect to the network via a proxy. Find the Java control
                panel and try changing the network proxy settings. For example, if you're using a
                proxy, try "direct connection".
       </p>
       <b>
        The Blocks Editor won't open: Java reports "unable to launch application".
       </b>
       <p>
        This can happen if the Java files are not being cached. Go to the Java control
                panel under "network" and make sure that "Keep temporary files for fast access" is
                checked. You can find instructions for opening the Java control panel at the end of
                the App Inventor documentation on
        <a href="/learn/reference/other/testing.html">
         Testing and debugging

        The Blocks Editor won't open: The application starts
       downloading and then nothing happens.
       </b>
       <p>
       To diagnose this, first verify that your computer can run the
               Java configuration tests and that you can load and run the
               Notepad test.  If not, you'll need to check your Java and Java
               Web Start configurations.   If Notepad runs, but the
               Blocks Editor won't open, then this is most likely the
               result of a firewall or other blocking software that is
               preventing the blocks editor from communicating with
               the browser, so check for firewalls and browser
               security blocking extensions.   There have also been
               reports of cases where this behavior has been caused by
               misconfigured virus protection programs.

        I'm having various Java problems, and I'm running on Linux and OpenJDK.

        Use Sun Java rather than OpenJDK. App Inventor does not work well with OpenJDK.

        I ran the App Inventor Setup installer on Windows, but the phone device drivers do
              not install.
       </b>
       <p>
        There are multiple reasons for this, and we're trying to track them all down. The
        <a href="http:/learn/setup/windows-drivers.html">
         Windows driver installation
                instructions
        </a>
        in the App Inventor documentation contain our best advice, and
                we'll keep those current as we get more information from users.
       </p>
       <p>
        Note that the drivers included in with the App Inventor Setup software do not work
                on all Android devices, and you may need to get drivers from the manufacturers. See
                the
        <a href="http:/learn/setup/windows-drivers.html">
         Windows driver installation
                instructions
        </a>
        for advice, and check the
        <a href="http:/forum">
         App Inventor
                Forum
        </a>
        to see if others have had similar issues with the version of Windows and
                the particular device you are using.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also, the driver issues around App Inventor are the same as for the Android SDK in
                general, so doing a Web search for driver issues around the Android SDK may also be
                worthwhile. It also might be worthwhile to search the

       </b>
       <p>
        It's not supposed to start. App Inventor is a Web application that runs from a
                browser. You run it by browsing to the App Inventor website (
        <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu">
         http://appinventor.mit.edu
        </a>
        ), as
                described in the documentation under Getting Started. The App Inventor Setup
                Installer software is something you need to install beforehand to let your computer
                communicate with the phone when you do start using App Inventor.

        When I open the blocks editor, the screen is blank.
       </b>
       <p>
        This probably means that there is a communication problem between the browser and
                the Blocks Editor, and does not reflect issues with the phone. One way to verify
                this is to drag a new component onto the designer and see if a drawer for that
                component appears in the Blocks Editor. If not, it's a browser communication
                problem. This problem is commonly caused by firewalls. If your computer is running
                a firewall, turn it off. This issue arises with Firefox if you are using the
                "noscript Application Boundaries Enforcer extension"(ABE)
                (http://noscript.net/abe/). You should turn the extension off: Open the options for
                noscript, go under the Advanced tag and uncheck the "Enable ABE" box.

        When I click "Open the Blocks Editor", something seems to download, but then

       </b>
       <p>
        The thing that was downloaded is a
        <code>
         .jnlp
        </code>
        file that tells the browser
                how to start the Blocks Editor. Most likely, your browser isn't set up to launch
        <code>
         .jnlp
        </code>
        files automatically, so you'll need to launch it manually; often
                clicking on the downloaded file works, but it depends on the browser. Some browsers
                will allow you to set the preferences to automatically launch the file in the
                future.

       <b>
        When I try to open the Blocks Editor, I get a message about locating the Setup
              software. What's going on?
       </b>
       <p>
        When the Blocks Editor starts, it attempts to find the directory containing the
                software installed with the App Inventor Setup Installer. If App Inventor cannot
                locate the directory automatically, it asks you to enter the correct pathname. It
                will remember that pathname for future sessions.
       </p>
       <b>
        The Blocks Editor behaves badly on Linux.

       <p>
        Examples of bad behavior include not being able to get project definitions for the
                phone, missing built-in blocks or drawers, and other strange things. Make sure you
                are using Sun's Java and not OpenJDK. App Inventor currently doesn't work correctly
                with OpenJDK on Linux. You will need to switch your selected Java installation to
                Sun's Java. Also, if you are using Firefox, make sure that it is set up to use the
                proper version of the
        <code>
         javaws
        </code>
        program when opening

        (Java Web Start) files.

        The Blocks Editor keeps telling me to unplug and plug in the phone. When I do
              that, it just keeps displaying the same error.
       </b>
       <p>
        This happens when the Blocks editor cannot communicate with the phone. Check that
                the phone has USB debugging enabled.
       </p>
       <p>
        If enabling USB debugging does not solve the problem and you are using Windows,
                then most likely the drivers did not install. Check the
        <a href="http:/learn/setup/setupwindows.html">
         setup information for Windows
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http:/learn/setup/windows-drivers.html">
         Windows driver installation
                instructions
        </a>
        . Perhaps your device is one that needs a driver from the device
                manufacturer.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you're using Linux, it is possible that the system is not configured to
                recognize the device. The following actions might help:

        First of all, make sure to wait long enough. It can take over a minute for the
                phone to connect. If nothing still seems to happen, unplug and plug in the phone
                and try again. Also try closing the Blocks Editor and restarting it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also check that the phone really is connected by the USB cable and that USB
                debugging is turned on: the phone should show both the USB icon and the USB
                debugging enabled icon. For Windows, check that the phone driver is installed. Look
                again at the

       <p>
        One cause for this error is if your computer cannot communicate with the phone over
                the USB connection, even though the driver is installed correctly. If your computer
                has a firewall, check to see whether it is turned on, and, if so, which ports and
                applications it is blocking. It might also be the case that some other program
                running on your computer has grabbed the port that App Inventor uses to talk to the
                phone, generally port 8700. Try to check that. (For example, on GNU/Linux or Mac OS
                X, in a terminal window, do "netstat -a" to see what ports are being used.)

       <p>
        It's supposed to disappear. If you want to use the app when the phone is
                disconnected, you'll need to package it and download it to the phone. If you are
                developing, and the phone accidentally becomes disconnected, you can continue work
                by plugging the phone back in and pressing "Connect to Phone" in the Blocks Editor.
                Once the phone reconnects, you're app should appear again.

There is a known issue with certain virus protection software, in particular the "Dr. Web" anti-virus app. Any app that uses the texting component (SMS) will generate the virus warning "android.smssend.origin.247". This is a false positive virus detection that you can safely ignore.

        I set the image property of a button (or other component) to an image file, but
              nothing shows on the phone
       </b>
       <p>
        There are several possible causes for this, so there are several things to try:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Make sure your phone has an SD card and that the SD card is not full. App
                Inventor uses the SD card for temporary storage of images, and the phone needs to
                have an SD card in order to run App Inventor.
        </li>
        <li>
         Make sure your phone's USB connection mode is
         <em>
          not
         </em>
         mounting the SD
                card. For example, on the Droid, you should set the connection mode to "charge
                only".
        </li>
        <li>
         Try unplugging the phone and plugging it back in. Followed by clicking on the
                "Connect to Device" button.
        </li>
        <li>
         If that doesn't work, close the Blocks Editor and refresh the browser window.
                Now restart the Blocks Editor, reconnect the phone, and see if that works.
        </li>
        <li>
         If that doesn't work, try packaging and downloading the app. Start up the
                downloaded app, not connected to the Blocks Editor, and see if the image appears on
                the phone. If the image does appear, then you'll have to continue developing
                without the image showing on the phone. You'll see your app in its full glory only
                after you've packaged and downloaded it, not while you're developing the app live.
                Please ask about this in the
         <a href="/forum/">
          App
                Inventor Forum
         </a>
         .
        </li>
        <li>
         If your image does not appear in the packaged app either, then you should
                suspect that there is something wrong with the image file. Perhaps it is not really
                an image file: Try examining the file with some graphics software. Perhaps it's not
                an image in a format that App Inventor can process: App Inventor can handle JPG,
                PNG, or GIF. Maybe the file is too large: try using graphics software to cut its
                size down to less than 300K.
        </li>
        <li>
         If none of these things work, try asking for help in the

        I set the source property of a Sound or Player component, but there's no
              sound when I tell the phone to play.
       </b>
       <p>
        If you are working with the phone connected to the computer, make sure the phone
                really is connected. Try using "Do it" on a few blocks, including the block that
                tells the component to play. Also make sure the phone's media volume is not turned
                down!
       </p>
       <p>
        If this doesn't help, try some of same things as with images, above. Watch out for
                running out of storage. (See

         Media

                Android (and hence App Inventor) knows about. MP3 and PCM/WAV files should be OK,
                but there may be issues with other formats. See

       </b>
       <p>
        If you get this error message you most likely are
                trying to reinstall an app on your device that you
                have previously packaged and installed with a different
                App Inventor service. For example, you might have packaged
                the app originally with the Google App Inventor
                service and now you are trying to re-package with the MIT
                App Inventor service, or with a service that someone
                else is running. If you don't have any data associated
                with the app on the device (e.g., in a TinyDB) the
                easiest solution is to remove the app from the device
                and then install the new version. If you need to
                preserve the data associated with the app, and you
                have a copy of the
        <b>
         <i>
          keystore
         </i>
        </b>
        that was used to
                package the app that is already installed, see below for
                how to upload the old keystore to the new service.

        and why might I want to upload or download one?
       </b>
       <p>
        Every Android app (".apk" file) needs to be signed
                with a key belonging to the user who creates the app
                (see
        <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/publishing/app-signing.html">
         developer.android.com/guide/publishing/app-signing.html
        </a>
        for lots more
                information on signing apps).  App Inventor generally
                handles this for you behind the scenes, so that most
                users don't need to think about app signing most of
                the time. However, you might run into a situation
                where you need to know about app signing if you move
                between different App Inventor services and you want
                to reinstall an application that was built on a
                different service while still preserving its local
                data. App Inventor keeps the key used to sign your
                apps in a file called a
        <b>
         <i>
          keystore
         </i>
        </b>
        . When you
                first start using an App Inventor service it creates a
                new keystore for you and uses that to sign any apps
                you package on the service. If you move to a different
                App Inventor service and want to keep using the same
                keystore to sign your apps (to avoid the
        <i>
         inconsistent
                certificates
        </i>
        problem mentioned above), you will
                need to download (or otherwise obtain) the keystore from the old service and
                upload that keystore into the new service. Options for downloading
                and uploading keystores can be found in the
        <b>
         My Projects
        </b>
        tab, under
                the
        <b>
         More Actions
        </b>
        menu. Note that
                the same keystore is used to sign all of a user's
                projects in a given App Inventor service, so you
                cannot designate one keystore for some apps and a
                different keystore for other apps.
