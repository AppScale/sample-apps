       <h1>
        Using the Activity Starter Component
       </h1>
       <p>
        The activity starter component lets you combine applications by having one
                application start up other applications. Activity Starter is mostly for advanced
                developers, but it's a key way to extend the App Inventor, because it means lets
                you take advantage of applications written by others, and created with other
                development frameworks.
       </p>
       <p>
        The apps you start can be App Inventor apps created by you or others; apps like
                Camera and Maps that are pre-installed on the device; or any app at all, created
                using App Inventor or not, as long as you have the necessary information to supply
                to the activity starter.
       </p>
       <p>
        For applications that are appropriately designed, you can pass values to the
                applications when starting it. You can also start an application and get back a result
                from it to use in further processing, provided that the application is designed to
                return a result. Presently, you can pass and receive text values only.
       </p>
       <p>
        To start another application, you must supply certain control information to the
                Android operating system. You do this by setting various properties of Activity
                Starter before calling the
        <code>
         StartActivity
        </code>
        method. This section gives
                some examples.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Starting Another App Inventor Application from your App Inventor App
       </h2>
       <p>
        You can start another app that was created with App Inventor if you know its
                package name and class name. If you have the source code of the app, you can find
                these names as follows:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         Download the source code to your computer.
        </li>
        <li>
         Using a file explorer or unzip utility, find the file
         <code>
          youngandroidproject/project.properties
         </code>
         .
        </li>
        <li>
         The first line will start with "
         <code>
          main=
         </code>
         ". Everything after that is
                the package and class name.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        For example, here is a first line you might see for an App named HelloPurr.:
       </p>
       <p>
        <code>
         main=appinventor.ai_HomerSimpson.HelloPurr
        </code>
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <code>
         HomerSimpson
        </code>
        part of the name comes from the App Inventor
                user account.
       </p>
       <p>
        To start this app, you would use an activity starter component with these
                properties:
       </p>
       <code>
        ActivityPackage: appinventor.ai_HomerSimpson.HelloPurr
       </code>
       <br />
       <code>
        ActivityClass: appinventor.ai_HomerSimpson.HelloPurr.Screen1
       </code>
       <p>
        Invoking the activity starter's
        <code>
         StartActivity
        </code>
        method will start
                HelloPurr. When HelloPurr finishes (if it does), the original app's
        <code>
         ActivityStarter.AfterActivity
        </code>
        method will be invoked.
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         Note:
        </em>
        If you are going to start another App Inventor app, make sure you
                use the correct package name. For example, if someone posts the source code (zip
                file) for an app, and you repackage that app, you'll end up with a different
                package name than he had. In cases of doubt, or if you don't have the source code,
                start the activity by hand on the phone and run
                "adb logcat" to view the Android system log and see what was actually started, as
                explained below in "Figuring out how to set the properties".
       </p>
       <em>
        Note:
       </em>
       If you will be starting a second App Inventor app that you yourself are
              writing, it's generally easier and more convenient to design the whole thing as a
              single multiple screen app, rather than creating two separate apps.
              See the section below on "Activity Starter versus Multiple Screen Apps".
       <h2>
        Starting a Builtin Phone Application from your App Inventor App
       </h2>
       <p>
        Apps that come with the phone can be invoked using package names and class names, as
                above. Android apps can also launch responses to an
        <em>
         intent
        </em>
        , which is the
                Android operating system's way of specifying something to do without necessarily
                designating a particular app. You can find information about intents (written for
                advanced developers) in the
        <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/intents/intents-filters.html">
         Android
                system documentation
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Some apps are designed to take extra information when
                they are launched. For example, maps can
                take geographic information that specifies which map to display. Another example is
                launching a Web search with extra information that specifies the text to search
                for. You must consult the documentation for the particular app to learn what this
                extra information is and how to specify it. Generally, you specify the information
                by setting the activity starter's properties just before the other app is launched.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here are some examples:
       </p>
       <h3>
        Start the Camera
       </h3>
       <p>
        To launch the Android Camera app, use an activity starter with these properties:
       </p>
       <p>
        <code>
         Action: android.intent.action.MAIN
        </code>
        <br />
        <code>
         ActivityPackage: com.google.android.camera
        </code>
        <br />
        <code>
         ActivityClass: com.android.camera.Camera
        </code>
       </p>
       <p>
        This is pretty much what the App Inventor Camera component does, although it is
                much more convenient to use the Camera component.
       </p>
       <h3>
        Launch a Web search
       </h3>
       <p>
        To launch a Web search for a particular query, such as "Homer Simpson", use an
                activity starter with these properties:
       </p>
       <code>
        Action: android.intent.action.WEB_SEARCH
       </code>
       <br />
       <code>
        ExtraKey: query
       </code>
       <br />
       <code>
        ExtraValue: Homer Simpson
       </code>
       <br />
       <code>
        ActivityPackage: com.google.android.providers.enhancedgooglesearch
       </code>
       <br />
       <code>
        ActivityClass:
              com.google.android.providers.enhancedgooglesearch.Launcher
       </code>
       <h3>
        Open the browser to a Web page
       </h3>
       Use these activity starter properties to open a specific web page:
       <p>
        <code>
         Action: android.intent.action.VIEW
        </code>
        <br />
        <code>
         DataUri:
         <a href="http://news.google.com">
          http://news.google.com
         </a>
        </code>
       </p>
       <h3>
        Start the mailer with pre-addressed message
       </h3>
       <p>
        To start the Android mailer application, use the action
        <code>
         android.intent.action.VIEW
        </code>
        . You can use Activity starter's
        <code>
         DataUri
        </code>
        property to specify the recipient, the subject, and the
                body of the message. In each case, starting the activity will bring up the Android
                mailer, and you can complete the message and then press "Send".
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, if you specify:
       </p>
       <code>
        Action: android.intent.action.VIEW
       </code>
       <br />
       <code>
        DataUri: mailto:santa@northpole.com
       </code>
       <p>
        then starting the activity will bring up the mailer, with the addressee filed in.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you specify:
       </p>
       <code>
        Action: android.intent.action.VIEW
       </code>
       <br />
       <code>
        DataUri: mailto:santa@northpole.com?subject=Please Santa&body;=Bring me a
              pony
       </code>
       <p>
        then starting the activity will bring up the mailer, with the addressee, the
                subject, and the body filled in. You can use the mailer to edit these before
                sending the message, if you prefer.
       </p>
       <p>
        The DataURI here must be a URL encoded message designed to work with the internet
                mailto service. Search the Web to find appropriate documentation and tools for
                creating these, for example
        <a href="http://email.about.com/od/mailtoemaillinks/a/mailto_elements.htm">
         Elements of a Mailto: URL
        </a>
       </p>
       <h3>
        Show a map for a location
       </h3>
       <p>
        If you know the latitude and a longitude of a location, you can show a map using an
                activity starter with these properties to show a map of the area:
       </p>
       <code>
        Action: android.intent.action.VIEW
       </code>
       <br />
       <code>
        DataUri: geo:37.8,-122.23?z=23
       </code>
       <p>
        The format of the DataURI is specific to the app. In this example, the URI
                specifies a z (zoom) of 23, which is the largest zoom value. Zoom value is optional
                and ranges from 1 (the entire Earth) to 23.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you know the zip code, you can set the activity starter properties as follows:
       </p>
       <code>
        Action: android.intent.action.VIEW
       </code>
       <br />
       <code>
        DataUri: geo:0,0&amp;q=94043
       </code>
       <p>
        If you have a street address, you can use a DataUri that encodes the address with a
                scheme called
        <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/ref_urlencode.asp">
         URL
                encoding
        </a>
        :
       </p>
       <code>
        Action: android.intent.action.VIEW
       </code>
       <br />
       <code>
        DataUri: geo:0,0&amp;q=5000% 20MacArthurBlvd%20Oakland%2CCA
       </code>
       <p>
        Generally in URI encoding the only characters you have to replace are spaces
                (
        <code>
         %20
        </code>
        ) and punctuation marks, such as comma (
        <code>
         %2C
        </code>
        ) and
                period (
        <code>
         %2E
        </code>
        ).
       </p>
       <h3>
        Play a YouTube video
       </h3>
       <p>
        You'll need to know the URI of the YouTube video. Then set the Activity Starter
                properties as
       </p>
       <code>
        Action: android.intent.action.VIEW
       </code>
       <br />
       <code>
        ActivityPackage: com.google.android.youtube
       </code>
       <br />
       <code>
        ActivityClass: com.google.android.youtube.PlayerActivity
       </code>
       <p>
        and set the Data URI to the URI of the video to be played, for example:
       </p>
       <p>
        <code>
         DataUri: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADwPLSFeY8
        </code>
       </p>
       <h3>
        Figuring out how to set the properties
       </h3>
       <p>
        If you can't find documentation for the activities you want to start, one way to
                figure out how to set the properties is to start up the activity manually and look
                at what appears in the Android System Log. For example, if you use YouTube to play
                a video, you'll see in the log:
       </p>
       <p>
        <code>
         I/ActivityManager( 86): Starting activity: Intent {
                act=android.intent.action.VIEW cat=[android.intent.category.BROWSABLE]
                dat=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADwPLSFeY8 flg=0x3800000
                cmp=com.google.android.youtube/.PlayerActivity }
        </code>
       </p>
       <p>
        If you can find the "cmp=" string, then the ActivityPackage is the part before the
                slash, and the ActivityClass is is the entire "cmp=" part, without the slash
                character. As in the YouTube example, there may also be "dat=" information that can
                specify with the DataUri property.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Starting arbitrary apps
       </h2>
       <p>
        You can use the Activity Starter to start any activity at all if you know the
                package name and class name, or the appropriate intent. Some developers document
                these intents for the benefit of other Android developers. For hints on starting
                other apps using intents, see the
        <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html">
         Android API
                documentation
        </a>
        or search the Android developer forums.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you have an app on your phone and you don't have the source code, you might
                still be able figure out the package name and class name (and sometimes the intent)
                by launching the app and inspecting the Android system log, as indicated above.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Receiving results from apps that you start
       </h2>
       <p>
        Some apps are constructed to return a result.  You can see that result as the
        <code>
         result
        </code>
        argument of the activity starter's
        <code>
         AfterActivity
        </code>
        event. Currently, App Inventor can receive text results only.
       </p>
       <h3>
        Returning results from App Inventor apps, and getting the result
       </h3>
       <p>
        You can create App Inventor apps that return a (text) result to their
                callers, so they can be used as subroutines. To return a result, invoke the command
        <code>
         close screen with plain text
        </code>
        (located in the Control drawer). Your
                subroutine app will terminate, and the argument of
        <code>
         close screen with
                plain text
        </code>
        will become available to the app that called it.
                If the calling app was itself an App Inventor app that used an activity starter,
                it will see that text as
                the argument to the activity starter's
        <code>
         AfterActivity
        </code>
        event.
       </p>
       <p>
        In more detail, suppose there are two App Inventor apps:
                A
        <code>
         SubroutineApp
        </code>
        designed to  be
                started with an activity starter and return a value, and a
        <code>
         CallerApp
        </code>
        that uses an ActivityStarter to call
        <code>
         SubroutineApp
        </code>
        . To return the
                result,
        <code>
         SubroutineApp
        </code>
        executes
        <code>
         close screen with plain text
        </code>
        ,
                giving it as argument the result (text only) that should be returned to the caller.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the caller side,
        <code>
         CallerApp
        </code>
        sets up its Activity Starter with the
                correct package name and class name for starting
        <code>
         SubroutineApp
        </code>
        . It
                must also set the
        <code>
         ActivityStarter.ResultName
        </code>
        property to the special
                text string
        <code>
         APP_INVENTOR_RESULT
        </code>
        . Then
        <code>
         CallerApp
        </code>
        starts
                the
        <code>
         SubroutineApp
        </code>
        activity. When the subroutine finishes, the Activity
                Starter's
        <code>
         AfterActivity
        </code>
        event triggers,
                and the result that was passed back from
        <code>
         SubroutineApp
        </code>
        will be available as the
        <code>
         result
        </code>
        argument to
        <code>
         AfterActivity
        </code>
        . That same information is available as the
                ActivityStarter's
        <code>
         Result
        </code>
        property.

       <h3>
        Calling App Inventor Apps and passing values to them
       </h3>
       <p>
        If you are writing an App Inventor
        <code>
         CallerApp
        </code>
        to call an
               App Inventor
        <code>
         SubroutineApp
        </code>
        , you can pass a text value
               to
        <code>
         SubroutineApp
        </code>
        .
                To do this, use an Activity Starter in
        <code>
         CallerApp
        </code>
        with the
                ExtraKey property to set to the special tag
        <code>
         APP_INVENTOR_START
        </code>
        and the ExtraValue
                property set to the text you want to
                pass. The
        <code>
         SubroutineApp
        </code>
        can retrieve that value by using
                the
        <code>
         get start plain text
        </code>
        block from the Control drawer.
       </p>
       <p>
        By passing and returning results, you can combine several App Inventor apps, both
                apps you write, as well as apps you share with others.
       </p>
       <h3>
        Returning results from arbitrary applications
       </h3>
       <p>
        Getting values back from other applications is like getting values back from App
                Inventor apps. In general in Android, an activity will
                return a result that is designated by a
                name, where the result is designated by a name, where the name is specified
                with the Activity Starter's
        <code>
         ResultName
        </code>
        property. The name to use for
                App Inventor apps is
        <code>
         APP_INVENTOR_RESULT
        </code>
        , as described above. Other
                applications, not created with App Inventor, will use other names, and you'll need
                to know those names in order get values back from
                those applications. In general, you'll
                need to consult documentation about the app you want to use as a subroutine.
                Some developers
                provide this information, or sometimes you'll have access to the source code.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not all Android apps use the
        <code>
         Result
        </code>
        and
        <code>
         ResultName
        </code>
        mechanism. For example, some apps return information via the properties
        <code>
         ResultType
        </code>
        and
        <code>
         ResultUri
        </code>
        . Again, you'll need to have
                information from the app developer to know which of these to use.
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         For advanced developers:
        </em>
        More specifically (with reference to the Android
                developer documentation) an app can be designed to return an
        <em>
         intent
        </em>
        . The
                Activity starter uses the specified
        <code>
         ResultName
        </code>
        to access
        <code>
         intent.getStringExtra(resultName)
        </code>
        to produce the result. The values
                for
        <code>
         ResultType
        </code>
        and
        <code>
         ResultUri
        </code>
        come from
        <code>
         intent.getType()
        </code>
        and
        <code>
         intent.getType()
        </code>
        .
       </p>
       <h3>
        Example: Picking files from the SD Card
       </h3>
       <p>
        Here's an example that illustrates using a third-party application:
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.lysesoft.com/products/andexplorer">
         AndExplorer from
                Lysesoft
        </a>
        is an application that lets you pick files for your SD card. You can
                call AndExplorer with an activity starter to add a file picking capability to your
                application. You'll need to have AndExplorer installed on your phone. You can get
                it from the Android Market.
       </p>
       <p>
        To start AndExplorer to pick a file, use an ActivityStarter with:
       </p>
       <p>
        <code>
         Action: android.intent.action.PICK
        </code>
        <br />
        <code>
         dataType: vnd.android.cursor.dir/lysesoft.andexplorer.file
        </code>
        <br />
        <code>
         dataURI: file:///sdcard
        </code>
       </p>
       <p>
        When you start the activity and pick a file, the resulting file name will be
                available as
        <code>
         ResultUri
        </code>
        . Also,
        <code>
         ResultType
        </code>
        will give the
                type of the file, for example, image/jpeg or audio/mpeg. Using this, you can write
                an app that lets you pick a file from the SD card and either displays the image or
                plays the music track as appropriate.
       </p>
       <h3>
        Is the application available?
       </h3>
       <p>
        If your app calls other apps as activities, you'll want to check that those
              other apps are available on your user's phone before trying to start them. You can
              check this using the Activity Starter method
        <code>
         ResolveActivity
        </code>
        , which
              returns the name of the Activity that would be started, given the package or intent
              information you've provided. If this name is blank, then the required application is
              not present, and you can warn your user.
       </p>
       <h3>
        Using the Activity Starter versus using multiple screens
       </h3>
       <p>
        The sections above explain how you can create an App Inventor app that calls
              another App Inventor app, perhaps with passing and returning text values.   If you
              will be writing both apps, it's probably better to make a single
              multiscreen app rather than create two apps and use the Activity Starter.  This
              will simplify things for your users, because they will need install only one app on
              their device.   Also, with multiple screen apps, you can pass and return lists as
              values rather than just text, and you can share values
              between the screens with TinyDB.
              See the documentation on multiple screen apps for details.
       </p>
       <h4>
        Note on upgrading old apps
       </h4>
       <p>
        The activity starter commands described here have
              changed from earlier releases, which used
        <code>
         close screen with result
        </code>
        and
        <code>
         get
              start text
        </code>
        , rather than the newer
        <code>
         close screen
              with plain text
        </code>
        and
        <code>
         get start plain
              text
        </code>
        .  If you load the source for an app from before 2012 and
              release 66, App Inventor will flag the old blocks
              and require you to replace them with the new versions.
