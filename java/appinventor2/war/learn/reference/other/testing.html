        Live Development, Testing and Debugging

       <p>
        The Blocks editor includes several valuable features to support
        <em>
         incremental
                development and testing
        </em>
        as you create your applications. You can also make use
                of the Java console and the Android log to explore problems, but these will be
                mostly of use in reporting bugs in App Inventor rather than in debugging your own
                apps.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Incremental development with the Blocks editor
       </h2>
       <p>
        When you create apps with App Inventor, you are working on the phone
        <em>
         live
        </em>
        :
                Drag a button icon to the Viewer and the button appears on the phone right then;
                change the button's color in the Designer and the color changes; drag out a block
                that makes something happen when the button is pressed, and you can press the
                button right then on the phone to see it happen.
       </p>
       <p>
        This kind of feedback is enormously useful, because it lets you develop and test
                your apps
        <em>
         incrementally
        </em>
        , defining each bit of new behavior and testing as
                you go along. Inexperienced programmers often make the mistake of building a large
                amount of stuff before they test any of it. Then, when they run into bugs, they're
                faced with a huge tangle to sort out, where they don't know which pieces are
                working and which are not. So try to work incrementally. You'll still surely
                encounter bugs, but incremental development will let you isolate bugs more quickly
                and fix them more easily.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to letting you try things by interacting with the phone itself, App
                Inventor includes features to aid in testing and debugging while you are using the
                Blocks editor. You can see these if you right-click on a block. This will bring up
                a menu, as shown here for a block that calls the procedure
        <code>
         MoveMole
        </code>
        :
       </p>
       <div class="imagecontainer">
        <img alt="" height="158" src="images/editorMoveMoleMenu.png" width="260" />
       </div>
       <p>
        Not all blocks will offer the same choice in the menu.
       </p>
       <h3>
        Do It
       </h3>
       <p>
        You can perform the action for a block with
        <em>
         Do It
        </em>
        . In debugging a program
                like MoleMash, you could select
        <em>
         Do It
        </em>
        for
        <code>
         MoveMole
        </code>
        and see if
                the mole moves on the phone.
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         Do It
        </em>
        not only does the block's action, but also puts up a balloon that
                shows the value returned. The figure below shows the use of
        <em>
         Do It
        </em>
        on an
                addition block to show the result of addding two numbers called
        <code>
         this
        </code>
        and
        <code>
         that
        </code>
        .
       </p>
       <div class="imagecontainer">
        <img alt="" height="166" src="images/editorDoItAdd.png" width="404" />
       </div>
       <p>
        Result balloons are attached to blocks at a point indicated by a small equals sign.
                You can click on the equals sign to hide and show the result. Moving the mouse away
                from the block makes the result balloon go away.
       </p>
       <h3>
        Deactivate
       </h3>
       <p>
        Sometimes you want to keep a block around that's not really part of your app. Maybe
                it's a part of the program that's not yet finished, or a block that's only
                partially implemented. Choosing
        <em>
         Deactivate
        </em>
        from the block menu will keep
                the block from becoming part of the app when you package it. Selecting
        <em>
         Activate
        </em>
        restores the deactivated block.
       </p>
       <h3>
        Collapsing blocks
       </h3>
       <p>
        If your app has many blocks, they won't all fit on the screen at once. You'll need
                to scroll the Blocks Editor window, and that can be awkward. One way to help keep
                screen real-estate small is to use
        <em>
         block collapsing
        </em>
        . If you click on the
                minus sign at the lower left of a procedure block or an event-handler block, the
                block will collapse so that only the title will be visible. Clicking on the plus
                sign will restore the block to full visibility.
       </p>
       <h3>
        Comments
       </h3>
       <p>
        Adding comments to blocks is a good way to help others understand your programs.
                It's also useful for keeping track of your own programs. Selecting
        <em>
         Add
                Comment
        </em>
        from the block menu brings up a balloon attached to the block, where
                you can type a comment as shown:
       </p>
       <div class="imagecontainer">
        <img alt="" height="152" src="images/editorMoveMoleComment.png" width="252" />
       </div>
       <p>
        You can drag the balloon around, or resize it. The comment balloon is attached to
                the block at a spot with a small question mark, that you can click to hide and show
                the comment. Or you can remove the comment permanently by right clicking on the
                block and choosing
        <em>
         Remove Comment
        </em>
        .
       </p>
       <h3>
        Watching variables
       </h3>
       <p>
        If you click
        <em>
         Do It
        </em>
        on a block that shows the value of a variable, you'll
                get a result balloon showing that value of the variable at the time you clicked.
                But sometimes, especially in debugging, what you really want to see is how the
                value changes as your program runs. Clicking "Watch" opens a baloon whose result
                constantly monitors the value of the variable, so you can see if your program is
                changing it as anticipated.
       </p>
       <h3>
        Complaints
       </h3>
       <p>
        Sometimes the result of doing a block will be an error. In the picture below, we
                changed the value of
        <code>
         that
        </code>
        to be the text "apple", and clicked
        <em>
         Do
                It
        </em>
        to add
        <code>
         this
        </code>
        and
        <code>
         that
        </code>
        . The result is an error, and
                a
        <em>
         complaint
        </em>
       </p>
       <div class="imagecontainer">
        <img alt="" height="200" src="images/editorDoItAddComplaint.png" width="404" />
       </div>
       <p>
        The complaint balloon is attached to the block at a small exclamation point, which
                you can use to hide and show the complaint. You can also remove the complaint by
                choosing
        <em>
         Remove Complaint
        </em>
        from the block menu.
       </p>
       <h2>
        System Logs
       </h2>
       <p>
        Besides the debugging tools in the Blocks editor, you can sometimes get information
                from various logs. This is generally for advanced users only.
       </p>
       <h3>
        The Android Log and adb(Advanced)
       </h3>
       <p>
        If you have problems on the Android device, you can sometimes get information by
                inspecting the
        <em>
         Android Log
        </em>
        . For example, if your application runs out of
                space, that will be recorded in the log. The messages in the log are not generally
                intelligible, but you can use the
        <em>
         Notifier
        </em>
        component to make your app
                write messages into the log, and this can be of some use in debugging.
       </p>
       <p>
        You can read the log using the
        <em>
         Android Debug Bridge (adb)
        </em>
        . The
        <em>
         adb
        </em>
        program is installed on your computer as part of the App Inventor
                installation process, and you can use the
        <em>
         logcat
        </em>
        option to view the log.
                You can launch adb from the terminal on your machine. Go to the directory
                containing the AppInventor Extras software and run the command
        <br />
        adb logcat
        <br />
        This will display the entire (large) system log. If you are debugging, you should
                open the log, stimulate the bug again, and see what appears at the end of the log.
       </p>
       <p>
        The actual directory for adb depends on your operating system:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         For MacOs it's /Applications/AppInventor/commands-for-Appinventor.
        </li>
        <li>
         For GNU/Linux it's /usr/google/appinventor-extras/commands-for-Appinventor
        </li>
        <li>
         For Windows, it can be in one of several places, depending on how it was
                installed. Search on your machine for the \Android\appinventor-extras folder,
                containing the file adb.exe.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        For more information on adb, see see the
        <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adb.html">

       <h3>
        The Java system log (Advanced)
       </h3>
       <p>
        Not all bugs will be your bugs. App Inventor has bugs, too, and you might encounter
                them. There's not much you can do here, other than report the bug, but you might
                get some idea of what's going on — or at least get information for reporting error
                messages — by using the Java console to display the system log.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Blocks editor is a Java program, and many of its operations write messages to
                the Java system log. You can see these messages if you run the Blocks editor with
                the Java console open.
       </p>
       <p>
        Running with the Java console open is a preference you specify for Java before you
                start up App Inventor. The details depend on which operating system you're using:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         For MacOS, go under Applications → Utilities → Java Preferences, and choose the
         <em>
          Advanced
         </em>
         tab. You'll see an option under
         <em>
          Java Console
         </em>
         to show the
                console.
        </li>
        <li>
         For Windows, go under
         <em>
          Java
         </em>
         in the control panel and choose the
         <em>
          Advanced
         </em>
         tab. You'll see an option under
         <em>
          Java Console
         </em>
         to show the
                console.
        </li>
        <li>
         For GNU/Linux you'll need to find the program
         <code>
          javaws
         </code>
         , which should
                be in the directory where Java was installed. The command
         <br />
         <code>
          javaws -viewer
         </code>
         <br />
         will open a control panel. Choose the
         <em>
          Advanced
         </em>
         tab. You'll see an option
                  under
         <em>
          Java Console
         </em>
         to show the console.
