       Frequently Asked Questions by Educators
      </h1>
      <h2>
       Do my students need to have Google accounts?
      </h2>
      <p>
       App Inventor users need to have Google accounts. The login authentication and storage for projects is linked to a Google account. But students don't need to use that account for any purpose other than App Inventor.
      </p>

      <h2>
       Can I have my students all use the same account?
      </h2>
      <p>
      App Inventor is not set up to deal with multiple users of a single account. With multiple users creating projects simultaneously, the information for the different users will interfere and the projects will become inconsistent.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Do I need to provide phones for all of my students?
      </h2>
      <p>
       We encourage those educators who have chosen to use phones to share ideas and experiences in the <a href="/forum/">
        App Inventor in Education Forum
       </a> about how they have acquired them. App Inventor offers the ability to develop using the Android emulator that shows up in a window on the computer screen. Using the emulator isn't as good as a physical phone, because students can't carry their apps around with them. But using the emulator does mean that you can run a class with only a few phones: Students can develop on the emulator and then load the apps on the phone for final testing and demonstrations.
      </p>

      <h2>
       Will there be curricula available using App Inventor?
      </h2>
      <p>
       We hope that educators will make their courseware available publicly and we intend to foster a community of educators for sharing information and resources. We encourage everyone to participate in the <a href="/forum/">
        App Inventor in Education Forum
       </a>. In the coming weeks, shared resources for education will be available at the <a href="http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/">App Inventor Edu</a> site.
