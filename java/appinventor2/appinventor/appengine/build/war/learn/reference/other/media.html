        Accessing images and sounds
       </h1>
       Applications built with App Inventor can access sound, image, and video sources
              from three different kinds of locations:
       <dl>
        <dt>
         Application assets
        </dt>
        <dd>
         <p>
          The sources labeled
          <em>
           Media
          </em>
          shown in the designer — part of the
                    application's
          <em>
           assets
          </em>
          — are packaged with the application. Anyone who
                    installs your application will have them, as part of the application. You also
                    specify them in the designer, which is convenient. You can also specify these
                    in programs by their file name: just use the file name without any special
                    prefix. For example, if you have an image asset named
          <em>
           kitty.png
          </em>
          , you
                    can use it as an image: just set the
          <em>
           Picture
          </em>
          property of an image
                    component to the text
          <em>
           kitty.png
          </em>
          . You can similarly use files names for
                    sound (Sound or Player) or video (VideoPlayer).
         </p>
         <p>
          Assets are the most convenient to use, but the space for them is limited to a
                    few megabytes, because they must be packaged with the application. They are
                    good for small images and short audio selections. Bit you would probably not
                    use them for complete songs or videos.
         </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
         The phone SD card
        </dt>
        <dd>
         <p>
          You can access files on your phone's SD (secure digital) card using file names
                    that begin with
          <em>
           /sdcard
          </em>
          . You could play a song on your SDCard by
                    setting the source of a
          <code>
           Player
          </code>
          component to
         </p>
         <p>
          /sdcard/Music/Blondie/The Best of Blondie/Heart of Glass.mp3
         </p>
         and starting the
         <code>
          Player
         </code>
         (assuming of course, that the song file
                  is on the SDCard). Make sure to specify the complete file name, including the
                  "mp3".
         <p>
          The Android system also includes an alternative way to designe SDCard files as
                    URLs. Here you prefix the file name with
          <em>
           file:///sdcard
          </em>
          and use "URL
                    encoding" for special characters. For example, a space is "%20". So you could
                    designate the same file by setting the player source to
         </p>
         <p>
          file:///sdcard/Music/Blondie/The%20Best%20of%20Blondie/Heart%20of%20Glass.mp3
         </p>
         Note that you'll want to use a
         <code>
          Player
         </code>
         component for this, not
         <code>
          Sound
         </code>
         . A complete song like this is too large for
         <code>
          Sound
         </code>
         to handle.
         <p>
          Images and videos can be designated similarly.
         </p>
         <p>
          App Inventor doesn't (yet) include any way to store files on the SD card. It
                    also doesn't (yet) include a way to list the files on the SDCard. You'll have
                    to use other applications or the Android phone file manager for that.
         </p>
         <p>
          Using the SD Card provides a lot more space for media than trying to package
                    things as assets. The drawback is that users won't automatically get them by
                    installing your application.
         </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
         URLs and the Web
        </dt>
        <dd>
         <p>
          You can access files on Web using URLs, starting with
          <em>
           http://
          </em>
          , for
                    example, setting the picture property of an image to
         </p>
         <p>
          http://www.google.com/images/srpr/nav_logo14.png
         </p>
         <p>
          and similarly for music and videos. Make sure you use the link that points to
                    the actual file, not to players for the files, which is much more common on the
                    Web, especially for music and videos.
         </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
         Other content URLs
        </dt>
        <dd>
         <p>
          The Android system also uses URLs to access various places that media is stored
                    on the phone. For example, the images in the photo gallery can be accessed with
                    file names beginning
          <em>
           content://media/external/images/media
          </em>
          , as you can
                    see by using the
          <code>
           ImagePicker
          </code>
          and examining the resulting image
                    path.
