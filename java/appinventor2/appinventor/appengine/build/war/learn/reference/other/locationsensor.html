       <h1>
        Using the Location Sensor
       </h1>
       <p>
        The LocationSensor component can determine the phone's latitude and longitude as
                well as a street address. You can use it to share your location with others, record
                "breadcrumbs" on a journey or treasure hunt, or as a way to take roll in class (as
                long as the students have Android devices!)
       </p>
       <p>
        The sample apps below are simple but illustrate the basic way that location can be
                determined. Both apps report the current latitude, longitude, and addres on the
                phone's display and, just for fun, speak the address aloud. The first app reports
                the location as soon as the sensor gets the data and every time the phone's
                location is changed. The second app only invokes the location sensor in response to
                an event-- when the user clicks a button.
       </p>
       <p>
        For each sample app, the following is provided:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         A barcode which can be scanned to
         <strong>

         the app on your
                phone.
        </li>
        <li>
         The source code (blocks) for you to use/
         <strong>

         . Download
                the file to your computer then upload it into App Inventor.

        <li>
         <strong>
          Annotated blocks
         </strong>
         to help you understand the app. The annotations
                  are block comments that will appear in the app when you upload it as well.

       <p>
        This app illustrates how to access location information only when some event
                occurs. The LocationSensor is disabled to begin, then enabled when the button is
                clicked and disabled once again when the location is determined.

        Variations

       <ul>
        <li>
         The second app illustrates using location data in response to an event. Write
                an app that responds to any received text by sending back a text that says, "I'm
                driving right now, I'll get back to you later. My location is ..." with the current
                location filled in.
        </li>
        <li>
         Write a "breadcrumb" app that tracks your (phone's) whereabouts by recording
                each location change. One interesting refinement would be to only record a new
                "breadcrumb" if the location has changed by a certain amount.
        </li>
       </ul>
