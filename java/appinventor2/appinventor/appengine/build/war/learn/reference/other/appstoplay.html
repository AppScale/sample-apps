        Uploading Apps to Google Play
       </h1>
       Applications built with App Inventor can be uploaded to Google Play!
       <dl>
        <dt>
        <h2>Version Your App</h2>
        </dt>
        <dd>
         <p>
          Every app you publish must have a <code>VersionCode</code> and a
          <code>VersionName</code>. You can set these in the designer under the
          properties panel for the <code>Screen1</code> component.
         </p>
         <p>
          <code>VersionCode</code> is an integer value that will not be visible to
          Google Play Store users. It is used by other apps to check if your app
          has been upgraded or downgraded. It defaults to 1 and should be increased by
          one with every successive change whether it is a major change or a minor change.
         </p>
         <p>
          <code>VersionName</code> is a String which can be anything you would like. It is
          defaulted to 1.0. A common structure is a decimal number which is
          increased by 1 for every major change and 0.1 for every minor change. For example,
          an initial <code>VersionName</code> could be 1.0 which can be updated to 1.1 after
          a small change and 2.0 after a larger change.
         </p>
	 <p>
	   You will need to increase the VersionCode and change the
	   VersionName of your application when you upload a new
	   version to the Play Store.

         <h2>Download <code>.apk</code></h2>
        </dt>
        <dd>
         <p>
            Once you are done making your app, you can download your Android
            <code>.apk</code>
            file as follows:
         </p>
         <p>
          1. Navigate to the home screen of the app you want to download in App Inventor<br />
          2. Click the dropdown labled “Package for phone”<br />
          3. Click “Download to This Computer”<br />
         </p>
         <p>
         This will prompt you to save the application somewhere. Once you have the .apk downloaded, you are ready to begin the publishing process.
         </p>

         <h2>Publish Your App</h2>
        </dt>
        <dd>

            You can now go
            to <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/Home" target="_blank">Google Play Publishing Home</a> and follow the steps to publish your app to Google Play.

	  <h2>A Word about Backups</h2>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  <p>
	    Once you publish your application in the Google Play
	    Store, other people will now be depending upon you to fix
	    bugs and otherwise maintain your application. It is
	    therefore very important that you backup your
	    application's source code.. Go to "My Projects", check the
	    box next to the name of your project and select
	    "More Options->Download Source." This will download a zip
	    file which contains your projects source code. Store it in
	    a safe place!
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    MIT and Google, which operates the App Engine service on
	    which MIT App Inventor relies, make best efforts to ensure
	    that MIT App Inventor does not lose projects. HOWEVER WE
	    CAN OFFER NO GUARANTEE THAT DATA (LIKE YOUR PROJECTS) WILL
	    NEVER BE LOST. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU MAKE YOUR OWN BACKUPS!
	  </p>
	  <h3>A Word about keystores</h3>
	  <p>
	    During the .apk building process your application
	    is <code>signed</code> with a digital private key which is
	    associated with your account. Whenever you build a new
	    version this same key is used to sign the new
	    version. When an android phone has an application
	    installed on it, it remembers the key that was used to
	    sign it. In order to install an updated version of an
	    application, the new application must be signed by the
	    same key. It is therefore important that you not lose this
	    key!
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Your private digital key is stored in
	    a <code>keystore</code> file. Normally the MIT App
	    Inventor server will create this file when needed and
	    store it for you so you do not need to worry about
	    it. Although we do not anticipate losing your keystore
	    file, we recommend that you back it up. From the designer
	    under "My Projects", under the "More Options" menu there
	    is a choice labeled "Download Keystore". Select this
	    option. This will download your keystore file to your
	    local computer. Save it in a safe place. It
	    should <b>not</b> be publicly readable as your private
	    digital key is a secret which should not be shared.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    If you move your project to another App Inventor server,
	    you will want to upload your keystore to that server (you
	    will see that under "More Options" there is a "Upload
	    Keystore" option as well). You only need to do this if you
	    are publishing .apk files to Google Play or if you intend
	    to share your application with other people in general.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    IF YOUR keyfile IS LOST OR DELETED IT CANNOT BE RECOVERED. If you
	    were to lose your project's source code, you could always
	    re-enter it from scratch (this may be a lot of work, but
	    is something you can do). NEITHER YOU NOR MIT CAN RECOVER A
	    LOST keyfile. NO AMOUNT OF EFFORT WILL RECOVER IT, SO BE
	    SURE TO BACK IT UP!!!
