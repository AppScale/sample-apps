       <h1>
        Displaying a List
       </h1>
       <p>
        You'll often define list variables to store data. For instance, the following
                variable stores a list of phone numbers:
       </p>
       <div class="imagecontainer">
        <img alt="" src="DisplayListAssets/broadcastListItems.png" width="436" />
       </div>
       <p>
        When you want to display such a list on the phone, you can plug it into the Text
                property of a Label, such as in this example:
       </p>
       <div class="imagecontainer">
        <img alt="" src="DisplayListAssets/simpleDisplayList.png" width="389" />
       </div>
       <p>
        On the phone, the items of the list will appear in BroadcastListLabel as a
                space-delimited list:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        (1112222 3334444 5556666)
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        The user can see the data, but it's not very elegant. Generally lists are displayed
                on separate lines or with commas separating each item.
       </p>
       <p>
        To display a list more elegantly, you'll
        <em>
         serialize
        </em>
        it-- write blocks to
                move the list items into the Label with the formatting you want. You can display
                the items on separate lines, add decorative text-- just about anything you can
                imagine. To serialize a list, you'll use a foreach block to successively add each
                item to the Label.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here's a sample that displays the BroadcastList on separate lines. The blocks are
                within a procedure which you call anytime the list is modified.
       </p>
       <div class="imagecontainer">
        <img alt="" height="299" src="DisplayListAssets/displayNumbersOnly.png" width="612" />
       </div>
       <h2>
        How the Blocks Work
       </h2>
       <p>
        The BroadcasatListLabel.Text is first initialized to a header, "Phone Numbers...".
                Then the foreach block begins-- all the blocks within it will be repeated for each
                item in BroadcastList. If the list has three items, as in BroadcastList, the blocks
                within the foreach will be executed three times. Each time the blocks are repeated,
                the variable pnumber has a different item in it. The first time it will have
                1112222, the second time it will have 3334444, and the third time it will have
                5556666. Each time the make a text block appends the pnumber to the end of
                BroadcastListLabel.Text, placing a newline chracter, "\n", in between.
       </p>
       <h3>
        The newline character "\n"
       </h3>
       <p>
        Text objects generally consist of letters, digits, and punctuation marks. But text
                can also store special control characters which don't map to a single character.
                "\n" is such a control character. When it appears in a text block, it means "go
                down to the next line before you display the next thing." So the text
                "1112222\n3334444\n5556666" would appear as:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        1112222
        <br />
        3334444
        <br />
        5556666
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Let's trace the blocks to see how the BroadcastListLabel is built. Tracing means to
                show how each variable/property changes as the blocks are executed. Since there is
                a foreach, we'll consider the values after each iteration-- each time the blocks
                within the foreach are executed:
       </p>
       <div class="advtutorial">
        <table>
         <tbody>
          <tr>
           <td class="tbl-header">

           </td>

           <td class="tbl-header">
            PhoneListLabel.Text
           </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
           <td>
            Before foreach
           </td>
           <td>
            n/a
           </td>
           <td>
            PhoneNumbers...
           </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

           </td>
           <td>

           </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
           <td>
            after second iteration
           </td>
           <td>
            3334444
           </td>
           <td>
            PhoneNumbers...\n1112222\n3334444
           </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
           <td>
            after third iteration
           </td>
           <td>
            3334444
           </td>
           <td>
            PhoneNumbers...\n1112222\n3334444\n5556666
           </td>
          </tr>
         </tbody>
        </table>
       </div>
       <p>
        As the table shows, the foreach block performs the task of successively placing the
                next item of BroadcastList into the variable number. On first iteration, pnumber is
                1112222, on second 3334444, and on third 5556666. foreach does part of the work for
                you-- you don't have to explicitly set the variable pnumber to one of the items in
                the list.
       </p>
       <p>
        The blocks within the foreach append a "\n" and the number to the previous value of
                PhoneListLabel.Text. So after each iteration, the label becomes larger and holds
                one more phone number (and one more newline). By the end of the foreach,
                PhoneListLabel.Text is set so that the numbers will appear as:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        1112222
        <br />
        3334444
