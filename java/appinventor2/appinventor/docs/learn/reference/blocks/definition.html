       <p>
        Collects a sequence of blocks together into a group. You can then use the sequence
                of blocks repeatedly by calling the procedure. If the procedure has arguments, you
                specify the arguments by using
        <code>
         name
        </code>
        blocks. When you create a
                procedure, App Inventor automatically generates a
        <code>
         call
        </code>
        block and
                places it in the
        <code>
         My Definitions
        </code>
        drawer. You use the
        <code>
         call
        </code>
        block to invoke the procedure.
       </p>
       <p>
        When you create a new procedure block, App Inventor chooses a unique name
                automatically. You can click on the name and type to change it. Procedure names in
                an app must be unique. App Inventor will not let you define two procedures in the
                same app with the same name. You can rename a procedure at any time while you are
                building the app, by changing the label in the block. App Inventor will
                automatically rename the associated
        <code>
         call
        </code>
        blocks to match.
       </p>
       <h2 id="procedurewithresult">

       <p>
        Same as a
        <code>
         procedure
        </code>
        block, but calling the procedure returns a result.
                After the procedure executes, the result is returned to the block connected to the
        <code>
         return
        </code>
        socket.
       </p>
       <h2 id="name">
        name
       </h2>
       <img alt="" src="images/name.png" />
       <p>
        Creates a named argument you can use when calling a procedure. You specify the
                argument by placing the
        <code>
         name
        </code>
        block into the procedure definition's
        <code>
         arg
        </code>
        socket. You can specify as many arguments as you like: each time
                you fill in an
        <code>
         arg
        </code>
        socket, another one will be created to accommodate
                the next argument. To name the argument, you click on the "name" label and type to
                change it.
       </p>
       <p>
        When you specify procedure arguments, App Inventor will associate these with the
        <code>
         call
        </code>
        block generated for the procedure: the argument slots for the
        <code>
         call
        </code>
        block will show the argument names you specified.
       </p>
       <p>
        For each
        <code>
         name
        </code>
        block you define, App Inventor creates an associated
        <code>
         value
        </code>
        block and places it in the
        <code>
         My Definitions
        </code>
        drawer.
                You use this block to refer to the value of the argument that is passed to the
                procedure when the procedure is called.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Note:
        </b>
        In the current version of App Inventor, argument names in an app must
                be unique, even across procedures. For example you can't have two name procedures
                each with a variable named "x". When you try to create the second "x" block, App
                Inventor will not accept that name. This restriction will be relaxed in the future.
       </p>
       <h2 id="variable">
        variable
       </h2>
       <img alt="" src="images/variable.png" />
       <p>
        Creates a value that can be changed while an app is running, and gives that value a
                name. Variables are global in scope, which means you can refer to them from any
                code in the app, including from within procedures.
       </p>
       <p>
        When you create a new variable block, App Inventor chooses a unique name
                automatically. You can click on the name and type to change it. Variable names in
                an app must be unique. App Inventor will not let you define two variables in the
                same app with the same name.
       </p>
       <p>
        When you create a variable, App Inventor will automatically create two associated
                blocks, and place them in the
        <code>
         My Definitions
        </code>
        drawer:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         The
         <code>
          global
         </code>
         block gets the value of the variable.
        </li>
        <li>
         The
         <code>
          set global
         </code>
         block changes the value of the variable.
        </li>
       </ul>
       You can rename a variable at any time while you are building the app, and the
              associated blocks will be renamed automatically.
       <h2 id="gets">
        |
       </h2>
       <img alt="" src="images/gets.png" />
       <p>
        This block provides a "dummy socket" for fitting a block that has a plug on its
                left into a place where there is no socket, such as one of the sequence of blocks
                in the
        <code>
         do
        </code>
        part of a procedure or an
        <code>
         if
        </code>
        block. The block
                you fit in will be run, but its returned result will be ignored. This can be useful
                if you define a procedure that returns a result, but want to call it in a context
                that does not accept a result.
