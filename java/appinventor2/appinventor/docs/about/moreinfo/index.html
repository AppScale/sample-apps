        App Inventor for Android
       </h1>
       <p>
        You can build many different types of apps with App Inventor. Often people begin by
                building games like
        <a href="/learn/tutorials/molemash/molemash.html">
         MoleMash
        </a>
        or games that let you draw funny pictures on your friend's faces. You can even make
                use of the phone's sensors to move a ball through a maze based on tilting the
                phone.
       </p>
       <p>
        But app building is not limited to simple games. You can also build apps that
                inform and educate. You can create a
        <a href="/learn/tutorials/quizme/quizme.html">
         quiz app
        </a>
        to help you and your classmates
                study for a test. With Android's text-to-speech capabilities, you can even have the
                phone ask the questions aloud.
       </p>
       <p>
        To use App Inventor, you do not need to be a professional developer. This is
                because instead of writing code, you visually design the way the app looks and use
                blocks to specify the app's behavior.
       </p>
       <img alt="" src="../images/ScreenShotAbout1.png" />
       <p>
        The App Inventor team has created blocks for just about everything you can do with
                an Android phone, as well as blocks for doing "programming-like" stuff-- blocks to
                store information, blocks for repeating actions, and blocks to perform actions
                under certain conditions. There are even blocks to talk to services like Twitter.

       <h2>
        Simple but Powerful!
       </h2>
       <p>
        App Inventor is simple to use, but also very powerful. Apps you build can even
                store data created by users in a database, so you can create a make-a-quiz app in
                which the teachers can save questions in a quiz for their students to answer.

         </td>
         <td>
          Because App Inventor provides access to a GPS-location sensor, you can build
                    apps that know where you are. You can build an app to help you remember where
                    you parked your car, an app that shows the location of your friends or
                    colleagues at a concert or conference, or your own custom tour app of your
                    school, workplace, or a museum.

          You can write apps that use the phone features of an Android phone. You can
                    write an app that periodically texts "missing you" to your loved ones, or an
                    app "No Text While Driving" that responds to all texts automatically with
                    "sorry, I'm driving and will contact you later". You can even have the app read
                    the incoming texts aloud to you (though this might lure you into responding).

          App Inventor provides a way for you to communicate with the web. If you know
                    how to write web apps, you can use App Inventor to write Android apps that talk
                    to your favorite web sites, such as Amazon and Twitter.

       <h2>
        Remember the Beta Tag
       </h2>
       <p>
        As a Google Labs, beta product App Inventor still has rough edges and missing
                features. In some cases the rough edges include un-pleasantries such as:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Installing Windows device drivers
        </li>
        <li>
         Installing Java on your computer
        </li>
        <li>
         Fiddling with settings on your phone
        </li>
       </ul>
       We are working hard to smooth out the rough edges and we appreciate your use of
              App Inventor while we are in this beta state. It may sound a bit cliche but it really
              is true, your use of App Inventor today will help us make it better for the future!
       <h2 id="giants">
        On the Shoulders of Giants!
       </h2>
       <p>
        In creating App Inventor for Android, we're fortunate to be able to draw upon
                significant prior research in educational computing, and work done in Google on
                online development environments.

        The blocks editor uses the
        <a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/41550">
         Open
                Blocks Java library
        </a>
        for creating visual blocks programming languages. Open
                Blocks is distributed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
        <a href="http://education.mit.edu/drupal/">
         Scheller Teacher Education Program
        </a>
        and
                derives from
        <a href="http://education.mit.edu/drupal/openblocks">
         thesis
                research
        </a>
        by Ricarose Roque. We thank Eric Klopfer and Daniel Wendel of the
                Scheller Program for making Open Blocks available and for their help in working
                with it. Open Blocks visual programming is closely related to the
        <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">
         Scratch programming language
        </a>
        , a project of the MIT
                Media Laboratory's
        <a href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/">
         Lifelong Kindergarten
                Group
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The compiler that translates the visual blocks language for implementation on
                Android uses the
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/">
         Kawa Language
                Framework
        </a>
        and Kawa's dialect of the Scheme programming language, developed by
                Per Bothner and distributed as part of the
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">
         Gnu
                Operating System
        </a>
        by the
        <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">
         Free Software
                Foundation
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The educational perspective that motivates App Inventor holds that programming can
                be a vehicle for engaging powerful ideas through active learning. As such, it is
                part of an ongoing movement in computers and education that began with the work of
                Seymour Papert and the MIT Logo Group in the 1960s.
