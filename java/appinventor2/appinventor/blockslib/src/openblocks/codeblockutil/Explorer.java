/**
 * An Explorer explores canvases.
 *
 * The philosophy above simplifies the relationship between the
 * various low-level and high-level components used to display
 * mulitple canvases in a limited space.
 *
 * An explorer commands a set of Canvases and tells them where
 * to go, when to be visbilty, when to not be visible, and how
 * they should "hide" themselves when not being used.
 *
 * There are many ways to achieve this UI.  One way is to
 * exmploy the "stack" loook and feel, where each canvas is
 * stacked on top of each other.  Another more common
 * solution is the tabbed look and feel, where each canvas
 * is a tab.  Other possibilities consists of internal windows,
 * hiding toolpane, etc.
 *
 * Remember, an Explorer is simply a controller of
 * canvases.  Nothing more.  ANY subtype of Explorer
 * should hold this aspect as true.  Never should an Explorer
 * be any less than an explorer of canvases.
 *
 * @specfield set of canvases
 * @specfield JComponent representation
 * @specfield name -- THE NAME MAY ONLY BE SET ONCE
