The files in this directory are for supporting an App Inventor
buildserver on a Ubuntu Linux server.[*] What you do:

 * Create an account named "buildserver":

   prompt% sudo adduser buildserver --system

 * copy launch-buildserver and buildmonitor.py to
   /home/buildserver/

 * Create /home/buildserver/lib

 * Copy file files from
   ${ROOT}/appinventor/buildserver/build/run/lib/*
   to /home/buildserver/lib/

   (${ROOT} is the source root directory)

 * Copy buildserver.conf to /etc/init/buildserver.conf

You can now start the buildserver via:

   prompt% sudo start buildserver

Note: The buildserver will now automatically start when the server
boots. The buildmonitor.py script arranges to restart the buildserver
if it exits. So you cannot just kill the buildserver java
program. Instead you "sudo stop buildserver" which instructs "upstart"
(the Ubuntu daemon management program) to shut it down.

[*] Valid at least as of Ubuntu 12.04LTS
