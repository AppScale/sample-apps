  // - The TinyWebDB.ShowAlert method was removed. Notifier.ShowAlert should be used instead.
  public static final int TINYWEBDB_COMPONENT_VERSION = 2;

  // For TWITTER_COMPONENT_VERSION 2:
  // - The Authorize method and IsAuthorized event handler were added to support
  //   OAuth authentication (now requred by Twitter). These
  //   should be used instead of Login and IsLoggedIn. Login is still there but
  //   calling Login pops up a notification to use Authorize. IsLoggedIn will
  //   be changed to IsAuthorized when the blocks file is upgraded.
  // - Added CheckAuthorized method to check whether the user is already
  //   logged in and call IsAuthorized if so. We save the accessToken across app
  //   invocations, so it is possible that the app already has authorization
  //   when it starts up.
  // - Added DeAuthorize method to forget authorization token (logout, effectively).
  // - Added ConsumerKey and ConsumerSecret designer properties (required for
  //   Authorize)
  // - Added Username read-only property that returns the Twitter username when
  //   the user is logged in.
  // - The friend timeline was changed to be a list of tuples (lists), where
  //   each sub-list is (username message). The old format was just a list
  //   of messages and didn't include the username associated with each message.
  // For TWITTER_COMPONENT_VERSION 3:
  // - The 'SetStatus' procedure has been changed to 'Tweet' to be more intuitive.
  // - Added 'TweetWithImage' which uploads an image to TwitPic and adds it to
  //   a tweet to allow a user to tweet with a picture. This requires a TwitPic_API_Key
  //   property.
  public static final int TWITTER_COMPONENT_VERSION = 3;

  // - The AlignVertical property was added

  // For WEB_COMPONENT_VERSION 2:
  // - The RequestHeaders and AllowCookies properties were added.
  // - The BuildPostData and ClearCookies methods were added.
  // - The existing PostText method was renamed to PostTextWithEncoding, and a new PostText
  //   method was added.
  // For WEB_COMPONENT_VERSION 3:
  // - PUT and DELETE Actions added (PutText, PutTextWithEncoding, PutFile, and Delete).

  // For WEBVIEWER_COMPONENT_VERSION 2:
