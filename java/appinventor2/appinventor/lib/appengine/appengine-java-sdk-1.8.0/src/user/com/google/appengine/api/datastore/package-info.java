 * Provides persistent storage, also accessible via <a
 * href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-jsp-135919.html">JDO</a>
 * or <a
 * href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javaee/jpa-137156.html">JPA</a>
 * interfaces.  It provides redundant storage for fault-tolerance.
 *
 * <p>A common pattern of usage is:
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Get a handle on the datastore itself
 * DatastoreService datastore = DatastoreServiceFactory.getDatastoreService();
 *
 * // Lookup data by known key name
 * Entity userEntity = datastore.get(KeyFactory.createKey("UserInfo", email));
 *
 * // Or perform a query
 * Query query = new Query("Task");
 * query.addFilter("dueDate", Query.FilterOperator.LESS_THAN, today);
 * for (Entity taskEntity : datastore.prepare(query).asIterable()) {
 *   if ("done".equals(taskEntity.getProperty("status"))) {
 *     datastore.delete(taskEntity);
 *   } else {
 *     taskEntity.setProperty("status", "overdue");
 *     datastore.put(taskEntity);
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This illustrates several basic points:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The actual datastore itself is accessed through a
 *      {@link com.google.appengine.api.datastore.DatastoreService} object,
 *      produced from a {@link com.google.appengine.api.datastore.DatastoreServiceFactory}.
 * <li> The unit of storage is the {@link com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Entity}
 *      object, which are of named kinds ("UserInfo" and "Task" above).
 * <li> Entities have a {@link com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Key} value,
 *      which can be created by a {@link com.google.appengine.api.datastore.KeyFactory}
 *      to retrieve a specific known entity.  If the key is not readily
 *      determined, then {@link com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Query}
 *      objects can be used to retrieve one Entity, multiple as a list, {@link
 *      java.lang.Iterable}, or {@link java.util.Iterator}, or to retrieve the
 *      count of matching entities.
 * <li> Entities have named properties, the values of which may be basic types
 *      or collections of basic types.  Richer objects, of course, may be
 *      stored if serialized as byte arrays, although that may prevent
 *      effective querying by those properties.
 * <li> Entities may be associated in a tree structure; the {@link
 *      com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Query} in the snippet above searches
 *      only for Task entities associated with a specific UserInfo entity, and
 *      then filters those for Tasks due before today.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In production, non-trivial queries cannot be performed until one
 * or more indexes have been built to ensure that the individual
 * queries can be processed efficiently.  You can specify the set of
 * indexes your application requires in a
 * {@code WEB-INF/datastore-indexes.xml} file, or they can be
 * generated automatically as you test your application in the
 * Development Server.  If a query requires an index that cannot be
 * found, a {@link com.google.appengine.api.datastore.DatastoreNeedIndexException}
 * will be thrown at runtime.
 *
 * <p>Although Google App Engine allows many versions of your
 * application to be accessible, there is only one datastore for your
 * application, shared by all versions.  Similarly, the set of indexes
 * is shared by all application versions.
 *
 * <p>Application authors may also consider using either of the
 * provided JDO or JPA interfaces to the datastore.
