/**
 * Identifies a callback method to be invoked after an {@link Entity} of any of

 * not provided the callback will execute for all kinds.  Methods with this
 * annotation must return {@code void}, must accept a single argument of type
 * {@link DeleteContext}, must not throw any checked exceptions, must not be
 * static, and must belong to a class with a no-arg constructor.  Neither the
 * method nor the no-arg constructor of the class to which it belongs are
 * required to be public.  Methods with this annotation are free to throw any
 * unchecked exception they like.  Throwing an unchecked exception will prevent
 * callbacks that have not yet been executed from running, and the exception
 * will propagate to the code that invoked the datastore operation that
 * resulted in the invocation of the callback.  Throwing an unchecked exception
 * from a callback will <b>not</b> have any impact on the result of the
 * datastore operation.  Methods with this annotation will not be invoked if
 * the datastore operation fails.
