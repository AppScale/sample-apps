 * Identifies a callback method to be invoked before a {@link Query} for any
 * of the specified kinds is executed against the datastore.  If {@link #kinds()}
 * is not provided the callback will execute for queries against all kinds,
 * including kind-less queries.  Methods with this annotation must return
 * {@code void}, must accept a single argument of type {@link PreQueryContext},
 * must not throw any checked exceptions, must not be static, and must belong
 * to a class with a no-arg constructor.  Neither the method nor the no-arg
 * constructor of the class to which it belongs are required to be public.
 * Methods with this annotation are free to throw any unchecked exception they
 * like.  Throwing an unchecked exception will prevent callbacks that have not
 * yet been executed from running, and the exception will propagate to the code
 * that invoked the datastore operation that resulted in the invocation of the
 * callback.  Throwing an unchecked exception from a callback will prevent the
 * datastore operation from executing.
